his mammography section of the Illustrated BI-RADS® Fifth Edition is an extension of the Fourth
Edition and includes illustrations of each feature described. The mammography section is part of
the BI-RADS® Atlas, also including sections on ultrasound of the breast and magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) of the breast.
There are numerous changes, clarifications, additions and expanded definitions in this edition of the
mammography section that are covered in the guidance chapter and in the pertinent individual parts of
the section. The lexicon of mammography terms and the reporting format are meant to standardize the
language used in mammography reports. In particular, consistent use of BI-RADS® assessment categories
coupled with use of concordant management recommendations will help clinicians understand disposi-
tion of their breast imaging patients and aid in auditing breast imaging practicess.
The features we use to describe mammographic findings are illustrated in the BI-RADS® Fifth Edition.
The presentation of each feature is accompanied by mammographic examples. The legend beneath each
example indicates in capital letters the specific feature illustrated. If, as often is the case, an illustration depicts
more than one feature, the legend indicates all the features using lexicon terminology, so that each such
example serves to highlight more than one feature. However, the capitalized term indicates the feature that
the mammogram was chosen to illustrate, such as “ROUND, circumscribed, high density mass”. Where pos-
sible, pathology of what is described is included.
Sometimes, a single descriptor will not be adequate to characterize a finding. This is often true with the
features of calcifications and masses. Furthermore, a group of calcifications may include several different
types; for example, “punctate” and “amorphous”. If one type predominates, a single descriptor would be best;
if not, multiple descriptors may be preferred. One must remember that management recommendations
should usually be based on the most worrisome of the features. For calcifications, this may be the distri-
bution or the morphology. While more than one feature may be described, a single management recom-
mendation should be made, based on the most suspicious feature(s). Thus, a group of fine pleomorphic
and punctate calcifications may use all terms needed to describe the calcifications with a statement recom-
mending biopsy due to the presence of fine pleomorphic forms. One may also describe the finding as “a
group of microcalcifications with fine pleomorphic forms; biopsy is recommended”. This flexibility should
also be used when describing the margin of masses. In many cases, the margin of a mass will be partially ob-
scured by glandular tissue. If at least 75% of the margin is circumscribed and the remainder is obscured, the
mass may be classified as “circumscribed.” If, however, a mass margin is partially circumscribed and partially
indistinct, it should be classified on the basis of its indistinct margin.
The mammography section clearly defines a positive and negative mammographic examination, how
“truth” is established for each, and the role of assessment categories and management recommendations
in making these determinations. If malignancy is diagnosed within 1 year of the mammogram, this is con-
sidered “positive” as far as proof or “truth” is concerned and the absence of malignant diagnosis in the same
time period is considered “negative”. Thus a mammogram assessed as BI-RADS® Category 0 with additional
imaging recommended for which cancer is discovered within 1 year would be a true positive examination.
Practical examples are presented and then characterized using the definitions included in this section. Please
note that a mammogram assessed as BI-RADS® Category 6 is not to be included in the audit process since
there is already a known biopsy-proven malignancy. Inclusion of such examinations would inappropriately
skew performance parameters such as cancer detection rate and positive predictive value, thereby con-

founding the understanding of auditing outcomes and complicating the process of considering whether to
remediate deficiencies.
The guidance chapter, first introduced in the Fourth Edition in response to many questions and sug-
gestions concerning terminology and auditing, has been greatly expanded in the Fifth Edition. In this
chapter we explain in detail the proper use of BI-RADS® assessment categories, the introduction to the
mammography report of a separate “Management Recommendation” section immediately following the
BI-RADS® Assessment section, how to achieve concordance between assessment and management rec-
ommendation, and how to report the few clinical scenarios when assessment and management recom-
mendation are not fully concordant.
All mammography reporting system vendors licensed to use BI-RADS® terminology in their software
will have access to the files for the Fifth Edition of the Atlas in sufficient time to update their applications
within the 180 days stipulated by the signed license agreement they have with the American College of
Radiology. Users should verify that their equipment has been updated with the most recent software or
request updates from their vendors to ensure that their automated reporting is up to date and accurate.
All mammographic images in the Fifth Edition are displayed with the right breast on the left, nipple
facing to the left, in concert with standard display of all radiographic images. This represents a change from
previous BI-RADS® Editions, when screen-film mammography was the prevalent technology and when
only half of interpreting physicians viewed mammographic images using this orientation (the other half
preferred the opposite orientation because this allowed the observer to face the emulsion [dull] side of
films, thereby reducing glare). Now that digital mammography has become the prevalent technology, the
argument for “opposite”-orientation display is increasingly becoming moot. A major goal of BI-RADS® is to
promote consistency and uniformity in reporting breast imaging examinations, so the acceptance of uni-
form-display orientation is meant to facilitate this goal. However, those interpreting physicians who have
recently switched or will switch from opposite- to standard-orientation display should take precautions to
avoid right-left confusion.
This illustrated Fifth Edition of the BI-RADS® Atlas is designed for everyday practice and should make it
possible to issue meaningful and unambiguous breast imaging reports. BI-RADS® was always intended to be
a dynamic and evolving document that would adapt to changes in the practice of breast imaging and be of
practical use to interpreting physicians. Therefore, the BI-RADS® Committee welcomes any comments and/
or suggestions from its users and requests that these be submitted in writing or electronically to the ACR.
However, prior to submitting comments or suggestions, please first visit the ACR BI-RADS® web site at http://

### BI-RADS® ATLAS — MAMMOGRAPHY

## INTRODUCTION

# T

```
he ACR Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS®) is a quality assurance tool designed
to standardize reporting, reduce confusion in breast imaging interpretations and management
recommendations, and facilitate outcomes monitoring. Through a medical audit and outcomes
monitoring, BI-RADS® provides important structure for collecting peer review and quality assurance data
that may improve the quality of patient care.
All interpreting physicians and referring health care providers should be aware of the benefits and
limitations of breast imaging technologies. There are two major categories of women who may benefit
from breast imaging studies.
```
```
Screening
The major role for mammography is the earlier detection of breast cancer in an asymptomatic woman.
The efficacy of mammographic screening has been established by randomized controlled trials in which
significant breast cancer mortality reduction has been achieved by the ability of mammography to depict
ductal carcinoma in situ and infiltrating cancers at a smaller size and earlier stage than in control groups
not offered screening. There also are data accumulating that the adjunctive use of ultrasound and MRI
is useful in the screening setting for certain groups of high-risk women, covered in detail in the Ultra-
sound and MRI sections of the BI-RADS® Atlas. Although mammography can detect the majority of breast
cancers, there are some that elude detection yet may be palpable. Thus, despite the paucity of studies
demonstrating the efficacy for the clinical breast examination (CBE), the committee feels this remains an
important component of screening. In addition, although breast cancer mortality reduction has not been
demonstrated for breast self-examination, it would seem prudent to encourage its use, if only as a means
to promote awareness of good breast health practices including screening with mammography. By defi-
nition, mammographic screening involves the performance of the mediolateral-oblique and craniocau-
dal projections. Its goal is to identify the small subset of women who require further diagnostic imaging
evaluation among the much larger group of well women for whom periodic screening is recommended.
In some clinical practice settings, additional mammographic images and/or adjunctive breast imaging
studies will be undertaken immediately to solve a question raised on a screening examination. In the more
common setting, involving the batch reading of screening examinations, the patient will be recalled for
further evaluation to answer a question raised on the screening study.
```
```
Diagnostic Breast Evaluation
Mammography and other breast imaging modalities, such as ultrasound and MRI, also are useful in
the evaluation of women who have signs or symptoms that may suggest breast cancer. However, there is
no test or group of tests that ensure that a woman does not have breast cancer. Physical examination evalu-
ates different tissue characteristics than mammography and provides a unique set of information con-
cerning the tissues being studied. Just as decisions must be made based on mammographic suspicion
in the face of a normal clinical examination, management decisions also must be made based on clinical
findings in the face of a negative mammogram. Because it is a well-established fact that mammography
does not reveal all breast cancers, some of which may be palpable, a statement indicating diminished
accuracy of mammography in the dense breast is often warranted.
In addition, a finding of clinical concern that has no mammographic correlate must be evaluated
independently of the mammographic findings. Ultrasound is often helpful in this setting; given the
```

### FIFTH EDITION — 2013

```
combination of a negative mammogram and negative sonogram, the likelihood of malignancy has
been shown to range from 0.1% to 4% (1-6). A statement in the report should be included indicating
the need for final management based on findings at clinical breast examination, in which the later-
ality, o’clock position, and distance from the nipple of the symptomatic lesion are described (to the
extent known), in order to aid the referring clinician in identifying the site at which CBE should be tar-
geted. However, universal (non-tailored) disclaimers are unnecessary since it is well established that
a negative mammogram does not exclude cancer and a clinically suspicious area should be biopsied
even if the mammogram is negative.
```
```
Despite the fact that biopsy may be undertaken for a suspicious palpable abnormality, mammogra-
phy is still important to evaluate the area in question as well as to screen the remaining ipsilateral and
the contralateral breast for clinically occult cancer. It also is important for women and their physicians to
understand that mammography screening is not perfect and that any noncyclic breast change should be
brought to the physician’s attention regardless of how soon this occurs following negative mammography
and clinical breast examinations.
The ACR Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System – Mammography is divided into 3 sections with
an additional appendix.
SECTION I: Breast Imaging Lexicon — Mammography
SECTION II: Reporting System
SECTION III: Guidance
APPENDIX
The following is a brief summary of each section.
```
```
I. Breast Imaging Lexicon — Mammography
The terminology used to describe mammographic findings has evolved over many years, and the
diversity of this terminology may cause confusion. The descriptive terms and definitions that follow have
been approved by the ACR Committee on BI-RADS® and it is hoped that all those involved in breast
imaging will adopt these terms and use them exclusively, so that reports will be clear, concise and stan-
dardized. It is believed that these terms provide a reasonably complete evidence-based categorization of
mammographic lesions. Any proposed substantive changes should be submitted to the ACR for review
by the Committee on BI-RADS®, as indicated in the Preface.
```
```
II. Reporting System
The reporting system is designed to provide an organized approach to image interpretation and re-
porting. It does not absolutely require use of computer-based reporting software, but such use is strongly
recommended. Not only does this facilitate clear, concise and standardized reporting, but it also permits
simultaneous data collection for the maintenance of a database used for future outcomes review (au-
dit). This will allow individual interpreting physicians and mammography facilities to monitor their own
results and appraise the accuracy of image interpretation so that they can adjust interpretive thresholds
appropriately. The ideal computer-based reporting software has not yet been developed, but it is strongly
recommended that use of software should involve a minimum of data entry. The interpreting physician’s
attention should be focused on the evaluation of images, not on interaction with a software program. The
simplest input utilizes a single screen for normal examinations and only limited interaction for abnormal
examinations. The goals are to maximize the image viewing time and minimize the distractions inher-

ent in reporting. If practical, we recommend use of a scribe to enter the data. Note that use of ACR-approved
computer-based reporting software is required for participation in the ACR National Mammography Database
(NMD) (https://nrdr.acr.org/Portal/NMD/Main/page.aspx), a quality assurance initiative designed to convenient-
ly and accurately produce clinically meaningful audits, with outcomes reported for individual interpreting physi-
cians and for an entire mammography facility, accompanied by comparison to concurrent benchmark data from
similar interpreting physicians, similar facilities, and all NMD facilities.

**Report Organization**

Use of approved terminology is key to the production of an understandable breast imaging report. The BI-
RADS® approach to reporting mammography examinations categorizes the overall composition of the breast
and then describes noncalcified lesions by their basic shape, border characteristics and density. Calcifications are
described according to size, morphology and distribution. The findings are then evaluated and an assessment
rendered that includes the degree of suspicion for malignancy at mammography. Finally, the report indicates the
pertinent management recommendation(s). Thus, the mammography report should be divided into:

**1. INDICATION FOR EXAMINATION
2. SUCCINCT DESCRIPTION OF THE OVERALL BREAST COMPOSITION
3. CLEAN DESCRIPTION OF ANY IMPORTANT FINDINGS
4. COMPARISON TO PREVIOUS EXAMINATION(S), IF DEEMED APPROPRIATE BY THE INTERPRET-**
    **ING PHYSICIAN
5. ASSESSMENT
6. MANAGEMENT**

```
Note that if mammography and ultrasound/MRI examinations are performed concurrently, the findings
at each imaging modality should be reported in separate paragraphs. Also, a single overall assessment
of the findings of both (all) examinations is recommended in addition to the mammography and other-
modality assessments. The guidance chapter describes in detail how to integrate the mammography
and adjunctive-examination assessments into an overall assessment.
```
**III. Guidance**

Over the years of continued BI-RADS® usage, the committee has received many questions and reports of prob-
lems related to the various sections that comprise BI-RADS®. It was decided to address these concerns, introduce
changes in terminology and assessments and explain the reasons for these changes in a single “guidance” chapter.
New or expanded definitions and terminology in the lexicon and the explanation for their inclusion are more fully
described in the guidance chapter. At present, some of the changes do not have supportive data; however, the
committee believes that inclusion is necessary to make the lexicon a more practical document. As was the case
with previous BI-RADS® editions, data accrue in the mammography literature and as this occurs, evidence-based
changes are made. An example of this is the inclusion of developing asymmetry in the lexicon and its assessment
as suspicious for malignancy. There now is scientific evidence that this mammographic finding is associated with
malignancy in approximately 15% of cases identified at mammography screening (7), a much higher frequency
than the approximately 1% likelihood of malignancy associated with focal asymmetry identified at baseline mam-
mography screening.

**A. MASSES**

```
A “MASS” is three dimensional and occupies space. It is seen on two different mammographic pro-
jections. It has completely or partially convex-outward borders and (when radiodense) appears
denser in the center than at the periphery. If a potential mass is seen only on a single projection, it
should be called an “ASYMMETRY” until its 3-dimensionality is confirmed (See Section D on Asym-
metries and also the Guidance chapter). (Insert links/page #s)

Figure 5 – SHAPE: ROUND. Although more than half of the
margin of the mass is circumscribed, it also is obscured by
adjacent dense tissue from approximately 1:00 to 5:30 (more

margin. Despite the possibility that this mass may have
only 3 undulations (suggesting oval shape), its primarily

2. MARGIN
    The margin is the edge or border of the lesion. The descriptors of margin, like the descriptors of
    shape, are important predictors of whether a mass is benign or malignant.
    a. Circumscribed (historically, “well defined” or “sharply defined”)
    The margin is sharply demarcated with an abrupt transition between the lesion and the sur-
       rounding tissue. For mammography, if part of the margin is obscured, at least 75% of the mar-
       gin must be well defined for a mass to qualify as “circumscribed”. A mass for which any portion
       of the margin is indistinct, microlobulated, or spiculated should be classified on the basis of
       the latter (the most suspicious component).

**Figure 9** – MARGIN: CIRCUMSCRIBED. Oval CIRCUMSCRIBED mass,
completely surrounded by fatty tissue. This mass was assessed as
probably benign after diagnostic mammography and ultrasound,
with subsequent demonstration of 3-year stability at surveillance
mammography. Presumptive diagnosis: fibroadenoma. Previously
published as Figure 1 (p. 774) in Leung JWT, Sickles EA. The probably

biopsy: fibroadenoma.

    b. Obscured
    A margin that is hidden by superimposed or adjacent fibroglandular tissue. This is used pri-
       marily when some of the margin of the mass is circumscribed, but the rest (more than 25%) is
       hidden.

**Figure 12** – MARGIN: OBSCURED. Oval mass, with margin
mostly circumscribed but also OBSCURED from 11:00 to 3:

obscured rather than circumscribed, based on this screening
mammogram. However, after diagnostic mammography and
ultrasound, the mass was assessed as probably benign, with
subsequent demonstration of 3-year stability at surveillance
mammography. Presumptive diagnosis: fibroadenoma.

    d. Indistinct (historically, “ill defined”)
    There is no clear demarcation of the entire margin, or of any portion of the margin, from the sur-
       rounding tissue. For mammography, this descriptor should not be used when the interpreting
       physician believes it is likely due to immediately adjacent breast tissue. Use of this descriptor
       usually implies a suspicious finding.

3. DENSITY
    This is used to define the x-ray attenuation of the mass relative to the expected attenuation of an
    equal volume of normal fibroglandular breast tissue. Most breast cancers that present as a mass
    are of equal or higher density than an equal volume of normal fibroglandular tissue. It is rare (al-
    though not impossible) for breast cancer to be lower in density. However, breast density is a sub-
    jective evaluation that is least reliable among the mammographic features of masses (i.e., shape
    and margin). Breast cancers are never fat-containing (radiolucent), although they may entrap fat.

**Abstract**

Radiographic density is considered an important feature in the evaluation of noncalcified breast masses, yet
no studies assessing its value have been published. The radiographic densities of 91 biopsy-proved, nonfatty,
noncalcified breast masses were evaluated by three mammographers. The density determinations made by
each observer were compared with the histologic outcome for the 51 benign and 40 malignant lesions. With
the kappa statistic, interobserver agreement was relatively poor (0.22 to 0.49), and intraobserver agreement for
one expert mammographer was 0.50. When the majority opinion of the mammographers was used, sensitivity
was 48%, specificity was 80%, and both positive and negative predictive values were 66%. As a solitary feature
in lesion analysis, mammographic density is difficult to assess and is of limited value for the prediction of the
benign or malignant nature of noncalcified breast masses.

**B. CALCIFICATIONS**

```
Calcifications that are assessed as benign at mammography are typically larger, coarser, round with
smooth margins, and more easily seen than malignant calcifications. Calcifications associated with
malignancy (and many benign calcifications as well) are usually very small and often require the use
of magnification to be seen well. When a specific typically benign etiology cannot be assigned, a
description of calcifications should include their morphology and distribution. Calcifications that are
obviously benign need not be reported, especially if the interpreting physician is concerned that
the referring clinician or patient might infer anything other than absolute confidence in benignity
were such calcifications described in the report. However, typically benign calcifications should be
reported if the interpreting physician is concerned that other observers might misinterpret them as
anything but benign were such calcifications not described in the report.

    a. Skin
    These are usually lucent-centered and pathognomonic in their appearance. Skin calcifica-
       tions are most commonly seen along the inframammary fold, parasternally, overlying the ax-
       illa and around the areola. The individual calcific particles usually are tightly grouped, with in-
       dividual groups smaller than 5 mm in greatest dimension. Atypical forms may be confirmed
       as skin deposits by performing additional mammographic views tangential to the overlying
       skin. Also note that if suspicious-appearing calcifications are adjacent to a skin surface on
       a given mammographic view, they actually may be dermal (hence benign) in nature, so that
       tangential-view mammography with or without magnification should be done prior to any
       intervention.

calcifications, but their intradermal location is diagnostic. Large
arrows demarcate the skin. Note that any tight grouping of
suspicious-appearing calcifications close to a skin surface on at
least one mammographic image should prompt tangential-view
mammography to establish or exclude intradermal location, prior
to an attempt at tissue diagnosis.

    d. Large Rod-Like
    These benign calcifications associated with ductal ectasia may form solid or discontinuous
       smooth linear rods, most of which are 0.5 mm or larger in diameter. A small percentage of
       these calcifications may have lucent centers if the calcium is in the wall of the duct (periduc-
       tal), but most are intraductal, when calcification forms within the lumen of the duct. All large
       rod-like calcifications follow a ductal distribution, radiating toward the nipple, occasionally
       branching. The calcifications usually are bilateral, although they may be seen in only one
       breast, especially when few calcific particles are visible. These calcifications usually are seen
       in women older than 60 years.

Abstract:
```
```
Objective:
The purpose of this article is to prospectively determine the prevalence and morphologic features of typically
benign large rod-like calcifications at mammography and to provide evidence-based data for this descriptor in
a future version of the BI-RADS® lexicon.
```
```
Subjects and Methods:
In the 1-year period of 2011, large rod-like calcifications were detected in 239 of 7935 (3%) consecutive women
undergoing screening or diagnostic mammography. Analysis of morphologic features was performed in 165
of the 239 women (69%; mean age, 71.1 years; range, 39-86 years), who had a minimum number of six calcific
particles and in whom benignity was assessed by lack of suspicious change compared with prior mammo-
grams. Two of the 165 women had undergone a mastectomy previously
```
```
Results:
The mean length of the longest calcification was 4.2 (SD, 2.4) mm (median, 3.5 mm; range, 1-14 mm). The
mean width of the widest calcification was 0.6 (SD, 0.5) mm (median, 0.5 mm; range 0.2-3 mm). Bilaterality was
found in 131 of 163 women (80.4%) with two breasts, periductal calcifications were found in 18 of 165 women
(10.9%), and branching calcifications were found in another 18 women (10.9%). One hundred fifty-five of 165
women (93.9%) had almost entirely fat or scattered areas of fibroglandular tissue; 10 women (6.1%) had het-
erogeneously dense or extremely dense tissue.
```
```
Conclusion:
Our results partially contradict the current description (size, diameter, and bilaterality versus unilaterality) of
large rod-like calcifications in the BI-RADS® lexicon (4th Edition). Content for this descriptor should has been
modified in the current version of the lexicon (5th Edition).

    f. Rim (historically, “eggshell”, “lucent-centered”) (See Guidance chapter)
    These are thin benign calcifications that appear as calcium deposited on the surface of a

       These are benign nongrouped calcifications that range from smaller than 1 mm to larger
       than a centimeter or more. The calcifications are round or oval, with smooth surfaces and
       lucent centers. Fat necrosis and calcifications in the walls of cysts are the most common “rim”

    h. Milk of Calcium
    This is a manifestation of sedimented calcifications in macro- or microcysts, usually but not
       always grouped. On the craniocaudal image they are often less evident and appear as round,
       smudgy deposits, while occasionally on MLO and especially on 90° lateral (LM/ML) views,
       they are more clearly defined and often semilunar, crescent shaped, curvilinear (concave up),
       or linear, defining the dependent portion of cysts. The most important feature of these calci-
       fications is the apparent change in shape of the calcific particles on different mammographic
       projections (craniocaudal versus occasionally the MLO view and especially LM/ML views). At
       times milk of calcium calcifications are seen adjacent to other types of calcifications that may
       be associated with malignancy, so it is important to search for more suspicious forms, espe-

2. SUSPICIOUS MORPHOLOGY
    Classification of breast calcifications by morphology is useful in predicting the likelihood of ma-
    lignancy. There are four descriptors of calcification morphology that usually indicate sufficient
    suspicion of malignancy to prompt a recommendation for biopsy. **Table 2** displays the results
    of several single-institution consecutive-case series involving suspicious mammographic cal-
    cifications classified by BI-RADS® morphology descriptors.

2. SUSPICIOUS MORPHOLOGY
    a. Amorphous (historically, “indistinct”) (See Guidance chapter)
    These are sufficiently small and/or hazy in appearance that a more specific particle shape
       cannot be determined. Amorphous calcifications in a grouped, linear, or segmental distribu-
       tion are suspicious and generally warrant biopsy. Bilateral, diffuse amorphous calcifications
       usually may be dismissed as benign, although baseline magnification views may be helpful.
       The positive predictive value (PPV) of amorphous calcifications is reported to be approxi-
       mately 20% ( **Table 2** ). Therefore, calcifications of this morphology appropriately should be
       placed into BI-RADS® assessment category 4B (PPV range > 10% to ? 50%). (see Guidance
       Chapter for a discussion of the optional use of subcategories of assessment category 4).

    b. Coarse Heterogeneous (See Guidance chapter)
    These are irregular, conspicuous calcifications that are generally between 0.5 mm and 1 mm
       and tend to coalesce, but are smaller than dystrophic calcifications. They may be associated
       with malignancy but more frequently are present in a fibroadenoma or in areas of fibrosis or
       trauma representing evolving dystrophic calcifications. Numerous bilateral groups of coarse
       heterogeneous calcifications usually may be dismissed as benign, although baseline mag-
       nification views may be helpful. However, a single group of coarse heterogeneous calcifica-
       tions has a positive predictive value of slightly less than 15% ( **Table 2** ), and therefore this
       finding should be placed in BI-RADS® assessment category 4B (PPV range > 10% to ? 50%).

    c. Fine Pleomorphic (See Guidance chapter)
    These calcifications are usually more conspicuous than amorphous forms and are seen to have
       discrete shapes. These irregular calcifications are distinguished from fine linear and fine-linear
       branching forms by the absence of fine-linear particles. Fine pleomorphic calcifications vary in
       size and shape and are usually smaller than 0.5 mm in diameter. They have a somewhat higher
       PPV for malignancy (29%) than amorphous or coarse heterogeneous calcifications ( **Table 2** ),
       but also should be placed in BI-RADS® assessment category 4B (PPV range > 10% to ? 50%).

    d. Fine Linear or Fine-Linear Branching (See Guidance chapter)
    These are thin, linear, irregular calcifications, which may be discontinuous and which are

       ance suggests filling of the lumen of a duct or ducts involved irregularly by breast cancer.
       Among the suspicious calcifications, fine linear and fine-linear branching calcifications have
       the highest PPV (70%) ( **Table 2** ). Therefore, these calcifications should be placed in BI-RADS®

3. DISTRIBUTION
    a. Diffuse (historically, “scattered”)
    These are calcifications that are distributed randomly throughout the breast. Punctate and

```
Figure 96 – DISTRIBUTION: DIFFUSE. DIFFUSE, primarily round
calcifications. Although many of these numerous calcifications have
radiolucent centers, not even one calcific particle projects over the
skin surface, making it unlikely that these are skin calcifications.
Similar diffuse calcifications were present in the contralateral
breast. Multiplicity, bilaterality, diffuse distribution, and absence
of suspicious morphology should prompt a benign assessment
(category 2).

3. DISTRIBUTION
    b. Regional (See Guidance chapter)
    This descriptor is used for numerous calcifications that occupy a large portion of breast tis-
       sue (more than 2 cm in greatest dimension), not conforming to a duct distribution. Since this
       distribution may involve most of a quadrant or even more than a single quadrant, malignancy
       is less likely. However, overall evaluation of regional calcifications must include particle shape
       (morphology) as well as distribution.

       tissue. The lower limit for use of this descriptor is usually when 5 calcifications are grouped
       within 1 cm of each other or when a definable pattern is identified. The upper limit for use
       of this descriptor is when larger numbers of calcifications are grouped within 2 cm of each
       other.

       nancy, as it suggests deposits in a duct. Note that both vascular and large rod-like calcifica-
       tions also are usually linear in distribution, but that these typically benign calcifications have
       a characteristically benign morphology.

3. DISTRIBUTION
    e. Segmental
    Calcifications in a segmental distribution are of concern because they suggest deposits in a
       duct or ducts and their branches, raising the possibility of extensive or multifocal breast can-
       cer in a lobe or segment of the breast. Although benign causes of segmental calcifications
       exist (e.g. large rod-like), the smooth, rod-like morphology and large size of benign calcifica-
       tions distinguish them from finer, more pleomorphic or heterogeneous malignant calcifica-
       tions. A segmental distribution may elevate the degree of suspicion for calcifications such as
       punctate or amorphous forms.

C. ARCHITECTURAL DISTORTION
The parenchyma is distorted with no definite mass visible. For mammography, this includes thin
straight lines or spiculations radiating from a point, and focal retraction, distortion or straightening
at the anterior or posterior edge of the parenchyma. Architectural distortion may also be associ-
ated with a mass, asymmetry, or calcifications. In the absence of appropriate history of trauma or
surgery, architectural distortion is suspicious for malignancy or radial scar, and tissue diagnosis is
appropriate.

The several types of asymmetry involve a spectrum of mammographic findings that represent

The asymmetry, unlike a mass, is visible on only 1 mammographic projection. The other 3 types of
asymmetry, although visible on more than 1 projection, have concave-outward borders and usu-
ally are seen to be interspersed with fat, whereas a radiodense mass displays completely or partially
convex-outward borders and appears to be denser in the center than at the periphery.

    1998; 208(2):471- 475.

**Abstract:**

**Purpose:**

To determine the radiographic and clinical outcomes of findings seen at mammographic screening on only
one standard projection.

```
Materials and Methods:
```
To identify prospectively marked benign-appearing and abnormal findings that were seen on only one stan-
dard projection, 68,836 consecutive 2-view mammographic screening studies were reviewed. Subsequent out-
comes analysis included determination of the frequency of occurrence, mammographic features, work-up per-
formed, and final imaging assessment. For imaging findings that prompted tissue sampling, histopathologic
diagnosis was recorded. To identify breast cancers among the remaining findings, screening cases were linked
with a regional tumor registry.

```
Results:
```
Of the 61,273 screening studies available for review, 2,023 (3.3%) involved prospectively identified findings
seen on only one standard projection. One thousand eighty-six (53.7%) studies with 1-view-only findings were
judged to represent superimposition of normal breast structures (summation artifact) simply from the stan-
dard projections obtained at screening; findings in an additional 587 (29%) studies were characterized as rep-
resenting superimposition of normal structures after recall for further diagnostic imaging. None of these 1,673
cases was subsequently found to be cancer. Cancers were identified in 36 one-view-only studies; 6 involved
ductal carcinoma insitu; 18, invasive ductal carcinoma; and 12, invasive lobular carcinoma (a large percentage
[33%], since only 10% of all cancers are invasive lobular carcinoma).

```
Conclusion:
```
Findings seen on only one standard projection are common among lesions identified at mammographic
screening. More than 80% can be correctly assessed as representing superimposition of normal structures,
either without or with the aid of additional imaging studies. Among those findings that truly are cancer, a dis-
proportionately high percentage is invasive lobular carcinoma.

    breast (at least one quadrant). There is no mass, distorted architecture or associated suspicious
    calcifications. Global asymmetry usually represents a normal variant.

3. FOCAL ASYMMETRY (See Guidance chapter)
    A focal asymmetry is judged relative to the corresponding location in the contralateral breast,
    and represents a relatively small amount of fibroglandular-density tissue over a confined portion
    of the breast (less than one quadrant). It is visible on and has similar shape on different mam-
    mographic projections (hence a real finding rather than superimposition of normal breast struc-
    tures), but it lacks the convex-outward borders and the conspicuity of a mass. Rather, the borders
    of a focal asymmetry are concave-outward, and it usually is seen to be interspersed with fat.
    Note that occasionally what is properly described as a focal asymmetry at screening (a finding vis-
    ible on standard MLO and CC views) is determined at diagnostic mammography to be 2 different
    findings, each visible on only 1 standard view (hence, 2 asymmetries), each of which ultimately
    is judged to represent superimposition of normal breast structures. Also, not infrequently, what
    is properly described as a focal asymmetry at screening is determined at diagnostic evaluation
    (mammography and/or ultrasound) to represent a mass.

baseline screening examination. The displayed spot-compression magnification ML and CC views show that the finding has
concave-outward borders, is interspersed with fat, and has no associated mass, architectural distortion, or calcifications.
There was no correlate at directed ultrasound examination. This finding was assessed as probably benign, with subsequent
demonstration of 3-year stability at surveillance mammography. Presumptive diagnosis: benign asymmetric fibroglandular-
density breast tissue. Previously published as Figure 4B (p. 768) in Sickles EA. The spectrum of breast asymmetries: imaging

4. DEVELOPING ASYMMETRY (See Guidance chapter)
    This is a focal asymmetry that is new, larger, or more conspicuous than on a previous examina-
    tion. Approximately 15% of cases of developing asymmetry are found to be malignant (either
    invasive carcinoma, DCIS, or both), so these cases warrant further imaging evaluation and bi-
    opsy unless found to be characteristically benign (e.g., simple cyst at directed ultrasound). Ab-
    sence of a sonographic correlate, especially for a small (< 1 cm) developing asymmetry, should
    not avert biopsy.

    come and pathologic findings. AJR 2007; 188(3):667-675.

**Abstract:**

**Objective:**

Developing asymmetry on mammography is a focal asymmetric deposit that has appeared or increased in size
or conspicuity since a previous examination. We examined the frequency, imaging outcome, and pathologic
significance of developing asymmetry.

**Materials and Methods:**

This study was performed in a retrospective cohort manner. We searched for all cases of developing asymmetry
consecutively entered into our mammography database from April 1985 to April 2005. We examined radiology
records to determine whether sonography and MRI were used as adjunctive diagnostic tools and examined
pathology records to determine tissue diagnosis.

**Results:**

Developing asymmetry was present in 292 (0.16%) of 180,801 consecutive screening examinations and 32
(0.11%) of 27,330 consecutive diagnostic examinations. After exclusion for absent data, the study consisted
of 281 screening and 30 diagnostic cases. In the 281 cases of screening-detected developing asymmetry, bi-
opsy was recommended and was performed in 84 (29.9%) of cases. Thirty-six cases of cancer were identified,
resulting in a positive predictive value of 12.8%, obtained by division of the number of cases of cancer by the
number of examinations with abnormal mammographic findings (PPV 1 ), and a PPV 2 of 42.9%, obtained by
division of the number of cases of cancer by the number of mammographic examinations in which findings
led to a recommendation for biopsy. Biopsy was recommended and performed in 26 (86.7%) of the 30 cases
of diagnostic mammography. Eight cases of cancer were identified, resulting in a PPV 1 of 26.7% and a PPV 2 of
30.8%. Of the 44 cancers detected at screening and diagnostic mammography, 21 had available sonographic
data. Five (23.8%) of these 21 cases of cancer had no correlate at sonographic examination. MRI was performed in
only 2 cases, both with benign diagnoses.

**Conclusion:**

Developing asymmetry is an uncommon finding. When this sign is identified on screening and diagnostic mam-
mography, the likelihood of malignancy is sufficiently high to justify recall and biopsy. Normal sonographic find-
ings do not exclude malignancy in the case of developing asymmetry.]

E. INTRAMAMMARY LYMPH NODE
These are circumscribed masses that are reniform and have hilar fat. They are generally 1 cm or smaller
in size. They may be larger than 1 cm and characterized as normal when fat replacement is pro-
nounced. They frequently occur in the lateral and usually upper portions of the breast closer to the
axilla, although they may occur anywhere in the breast. They usually are seen adjacent to a vein,
because the lymphatic drainage of the breast parallels the venous drainage.

F. SKIN LESION (See Guidance chapter)
This finding may be described in the mammography report or annotated on the mammographic
image when it projects over the breast (especially on 2 different projections), and may be mistaken
for an intramammary lesion. A raised skin lesion sufficiently large to be seen at mammography
should be marked by the technologist with a radiopaque device designated for use as a marker for
a skin lesion.
```

surrounding the mostly circumscribed margin of the mass, representing air trapped
during breast compression. These mammographic features are typically benign.

skin lesion and within some of its crevices. These mammographic features are

Abstract:
```
```
Purpose:
To review clinical and pathological outcomes for cases of solitary dilated duct (SDD) identified at mammogra-
phy.
```
```
Materials and Methods:
Institutional review board approval and waiver of informed consent were obtained for this HIPAA-compliant
retrospective single-institution study. For all screening mammography examinations during a 22-year period
and all diagnostic mammography examinations during the last 10 of these years, the interpreting physician re-
corded the principal finding of each abnormal mammographic examination during image interpretation. Only
examinations with the recorded finding of SDD were studied. We examined radiology records to determine
imaging follow-up, pathology records to determine histological diagnosis, and performed linkage with our
regional tumor registry to identify cancers not biopsied at our institution.
```
```
Results:
The finding of SDD was recorded for 9 of 235,209 consecutive screening (0.0038%) and for 12 of 29,267 con-
secutive diagnostic mammography examinations (0.041%). Five screening and five diagnostic cases were sta-
ble at follow-up (minimum interval, 2 years) and did not undergo biopsy; tumor registry linkage showed no
subsequent cancer diagnosis. Biopsy was performed for 4 of 9 screening (44%) and 7 of 12 diagnostic (58%)
cases. One cancer each (ductal carcinoma in situ) was identified from the screening and diagnostic popula-
tions, yielding positive predictive values of 11% (1/9) and 8% (1/12), respectively.
```
```
Conclusion:
SDD is a rare mammographic finding, this series being the largest reported to date. Although few cases are
studied, SDD appears to have a greater than 2% likelihood of malignancy, sufficiently high to suggest that a
suspicious (BI-RADS® 4A) assessment may be appropriate.]

    and which in the absence of any suspicious findings and when stable for a long period of time,
    is not a sign of malignancy. However, if nipple retraction is new, suspicion for underlying malig-
    nancy is increased.

    Enlarged axillary lymph nodes may warrant comment, clinical correlation, and additional evalua-
    tion, especially if new or considerably larger or rounder when compared to previous examination.
    A review of the patient’s medical history may elucidate the cause for axillary adenopathy, averting
    recommendation for additional evaluation. When one or more large axillary nodes are substan-
    tially composed of fat, this is a normal variant.

**I. LOCATION OF LESION**

```
The location of a suspicious lesion should be described using standard clock-face clinical orientation,
as extrapolated from image location. The breast is viewed as the face of a clock with the patient fac-
ing the observer. Use of both clock-face and quadrant location is encouraged because clinicians use
these location descriptors interchangeably; this also provides an internal consistency check for possible
right–left confusion (e.g., description of a right breast lesion in the upper outer quadrant at 2 o’clock is
inconsistent and must be changed before verifying a mammography report). The side is given first,
followed by the quadrant, clock-face location and the depth of the lesion. Depth descriptors arbitrarily
divide the breast into anterior, middle and posterior thirds. In addition, description of the distance of
the lesion from the nipple provides a more precise indication of its depth. This may be particularly help-
ful in determining whether an imaging finding matches the location of a palpable mass or in directing
ultrasound examination or a post-imaging clinical breast examination. The following is an example of a
lesion location description:
right, upper outer quadrant, 10 o’clock, anterior third, 3 cm from nipple
Full description of lesion location should be limited to examinations for which biopsy is recommended.

1. LATERALITY

```
Indicate right or left breast.
```
2. QUADRANT AND CLOCK-FACE

```
Use upper outer quadrant, upper inner quadrant, lower outer quadrant or lower inner quadrant. Twelve
o’clock lesions may be described as upper central, 6 o’clock lesions as lower central, and 3 or 9 o’clock
lesions as either outer central or inner central depending on laterality. Central is directly behind the
nipple-areolar complex on all projections. Retroareolar indicates central location in the anterior third
of the breast close to the nipple. Axillary tail indicates upper outer quadrant location adjacent to the
axilla but within the breast mound. The use of clock-face location will depend on whether the lesion is
in the right or left breast. Note that central, retroareolar and axillary tail descriptors are used instead of
quadrant descriptors and do not require indication of clock-face location.

**A. REPORT ORGANIZATION** (See Guidance chapter)

```
The reporting system should be concise and organized using the following structure. A statement
indicating that the current examination has been compared to previous examination(s) should be
included (specify date[s]). If this is not included, it should be assumed that no comparison has been
made, although it is preferable to indicate that no comparison was made.

Report Structure

2. Succinct description of the overall breast composition
3. Clear description of any important findings
4. Comparison to previous examination(s), if deemed appropriate by the interpreting physician
5. Assessment
6. Management

### 1. INDICATION FOR EXAMINATION

```
Provide a brief description of the indication for examination. This may be screening for an
asymptomatic woman, recall of a screening-detected finding, evaluation of a clinical finding
(specify the finding and its location), or follow-up of either a probably benign lesion or can-
cer treated with breast conservation. If an implant is present, both standard and implant-
displaced views should be performed and this should be stated in the mammography re-
port.
```
2. SUCCINCT DESCRIPTION OF THE OVERALL BREAST COMPOSITION
This is an overall assessment of the volume of attenuating tissues in the breast, to help in-
    dicate the relative possibility that a lesion could be obscured by normal tissue and that the
    sensitivity of examination thereby may be compromised by dense breast tissue. A few co-
    alescent areas of dense tissue may be present in breasts with as little as 10% dense tissue,
    whereas primarily fatty areas may be present in breasts with as much as 90% dense tissue.

```
Since mammography does not depict all breast cancers, clinical breast examination is a com-
plementary element of screening. While findings at clinical breast examination should not
be ignored, these clinical findings may have increased importance in the dense breast.
```
```
The available data do not support the use of mammographic breast density for determining
screening frequency.
```
```
The following four categories of breast composition are defined by the visually estimated content
of fibroglandular-density tissue within the breasts. Please note that the categories are listed as a, b,
c, and d so as not to be confused with the numbered BI-RADS® assessment categories. If the breasts
are not of apparently equal density, the denser breast should be used to categorize breast density.
The sensitivity of mammography for noncalcified lesions decreases as the BI-RADS® breast density
category increases. The denser the breast, the larger the lesion(s) that may be obscured. There is
considerable intra- and inter-observer variation in visually estimating breast density between any
two adjacent density categories. Furthermore, there is only a minimal and insignificant difference

Table 5. Breast Tissue
Breast Composition Categories
a) The breasts are almost entirely fatty.
b) There are scattered areas of fibroglandular density.
c) The breasts are heterogeneously dense, which may obscure detection of small masses.
d) The breasts are extremely dense, which lowers the sensitivity of mammography.
```
```
in the sensitivity of mammography between the densest breast in a lower-density category and the
least dense breast in the next-higher-density category. These factors limit the clinical relevance of breast
density categorization for the individual woman.
```
```
a) The breasts are almost entirely fatty.
Unless an area containing cancer is not included in the image field of the mammo-
gram, mammography is highly sensitive in this setting.
```
```
b) There are scattered areas of fibroglandular density (historically, there are scattered
fibroglandular densities).
It may be helpful to distinguish breasts in which there are a few scattered areas of fi-
broglandular-density tissue from those in which there are moderate scattered areas of
fibroglandular-density tissue. Note that there has been a subtle change in the wording
of this category, to conform to BI-RADS® lexicon use of the term “density” to describe
the degree of x-ray attenuation of breast tissue but not to represent discrete mammo-
graphic findings.
```
```
c) The breasts are heterogeneously dense, which may obscure detection of small
masses.
It is not uncommon for some areas in such breasts to be relatively dense while other
areas are primarily fatty. When this occurs, it may be helpful to describe the location(s)
of the denser tissue in a second sentence, so that the referring clinician is aware that
these are the areas in which small noncalcified lesions may be obscured. Suggested
wordings for the second sentence include:
“The dense tissue is located anteriorly in both breasts, and the posterior portions are
mostly fatty.”
“Primarily dense tissue is located in the upper outer quadrants of both breasts; scat-
tered areas of fibroglandular tissue are present in the remainder of the breasts.”
```
```
d) The breasts are extremely dense, which lowers the sensitivity of mammo graphy.
The sensitivity of mammography is lowest in this density category.
```
```
The Fourth Edition of BI-RADS®, unlike previous editions, indicated quartile ranges
of percentage dense tissue (increments of 25% density) for each of the four density
categories, with the expectation that the assignment of breast density would be
distributed more evenly across categories than the historical distribution of 10% fat-

been demonstrated in clinical practice that there has been essentially no change in this
historical distribution across density categories, despite the 2003 guidance provided in
the BI-RADS® Atlas (Figure 148).
```

### FIFTH EDITION — 2013

```
The absence of change in clinical practice of the assignment of breast density across categories
may reflect the reality that a few coalescent areas of dense tissue may be present in breasts with
as little as 10% dense tissue, whereas primarily fatty areas may be present in breasts with as much
as 90% dense tissue.
```
```
The Fifth Edition of BI-RADS® no longer indicates ranges of percentage dense tissue for the four
density categories. This is done to emphasize the text descriptions of breast density, which re-
flect the masking effect of dense fibroglandular tissue on mammographic depiction of noncal-
cified lesions, because the BI-RADS® Committee concludes that the association of subjectively
estimated breast density with changes in the sensitivity of mammography is clinically more im-
portant than the relatively smaller effect of percentage breast density as an indicator for breast
cancer risk.
The Committee on BI-RADS® indeed is aware of recent and continuing investigations of percent-
age breast density as an indicator for breast cancer risk, and by eliminating percentage ranges
we do not intend to compromise or impede any such research. We simply recognize the reality
that interpreting physicians will continue to use density categories in mammography reports as
they have done over the past many years, independent of BI-RADS® guidance on percentage
breast density. We further recognize that both subjective estimates and planimetry measure-
ments of breast density based on area as depicted on (2-dimensional) mammograms are im-
precise indicators of the volume of dense tissue, which may be measured using (3-dimensional)
cross-sectional breast imaging modalities (5). We await publication of robust volume-based
breast density data, using validated percentage cut points (not necessarily quartiles) that are
readily and reproducibly determined at imaging, before again indicating percentage ranges for
BI-RADS® density categories. We also urge avoidance of numbers to classify breast density in-
stead of BI-RADS® terminology in order to avoid confusion with BI-RADS® assessment categories,
which are numbered.
```
```
Some breasts may appear more or less dense when imaged using full-field digital mammog-
raphy compared to screen-film mammography. Superior depiction of the skin line by digital
mammography provides the observer with a more accurate (and usually larger) estimate of
the extent of the subcutaneous fat. However, no change in the distribution across density cat-
egories has been observed when comparing full-field digital mammography with screen-film
mammography (6).

Breast density is classified using the denser breast. In this case, because the
fibroglandular tissue in the upper outer right breast is sufficiently dense
to obscure small masses, the examination should be classified as HETERO-
GENEOUSLY DENSE, even though far less than 50% of the volume of this
(denser) breast contains fibroglandular-density tissue.

### 4. COMPARISON TO PREVIOUS EXAMINATION(S), IF DEEMED APPROPRIATE BY THE INTERPRET-

### ING PHYSICIAN

```
Comparison to previous examination may assume importance if the finding of concern requires
an evaluation of change or stability. Comparison is less important when the finding has un-
equivocally benign features. Comparison may be irrelevant when the finding is inherently suspi-
cious for malignancy.
```
### 5. ASSESSMENT

```
The incorporation of an assessment category in the overall summary of the mammography re-
port is federally mandated by the Final Regulations of the Mammography Quality Standards
Act (MQSA), Pub. L 102-539. Whereas MQSA-mandated assessments are not linked to manage-
ment recommendations, BI-RADS® assessment categories are designed to be concordant with
specific management recommendations. The linking of assessment categories with concordant
management recommendations further enhances sound medical practice.
```
```
All final assessments (BI-RADS® categories 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6) should be based on thorough evalu-
ation of the mammographic features of concern or after determination that an examination is
negative or benign.
```
```
An incomplete (category 0) assessment is usually given for screening examinations when addi-
tional imaging evaluation is recommended before it is appropriate to render a final assessment.
There may be rare situations in the screening setting in which a category 4 or 5 assessment is
used, but this practice is discouraged because it may compromise some aspects of outcome
analysis.
```
```
A recall (category 0) assessment should include specific suggestions for the next course of ac-
tion (spot-compression magnification views, ultrasound, etc.).
```
### 6. MANAGEMENT

```
If a suspicious abnormality is detected, the report should indicate that biopsy should be per-
formed in the absence of clinical contraindication. This is an assessment for which the interpret-
ing physician has sufficient concern that biopsy is warranted based on imaging findings. The
recommended language (“biopsy should be performed in the absence of clinical contraindica-
tion”) provides for the unusual circumstance in which either the patient or her physician might
reasonably wish to defer biopsy.
```
```
Interpretation is facilitated by recognizing that most examinations may be categorized under a
few headings. These are listed below and numeric codes are included for computer use.

a. Mammographic Assessment Is Incomplete
```
```
Category 0: Incomplete – Need Additional Imaging Evaluation and/or Prior Mammograms
for Comparison
For this assessment category, the text may be shortened to “Incomplete – Need Additional Imag-
ing Evaluation” or “Incomplete – Need Prior Mammograms for Comparison”, as appropriate. Refer
to Table 9 in Frequently Asked Question #1 in the Guidance chapter [Provide page number for
the print version and an electronic link for the web version.] , listing FDA-approved equivalent
wording for assessment categories.
```
```
There is a finding for which additional imaging evaluation is needed. This is almost always used
in a screening situation. Under certain circumstances this assessment category may be used in
a diagnostic mammography report, such as when ultrasound equipment or personnel are not
immediately available, or when the patient is unable or unwilling to wait for completion of a
full diagnostic examination. A recommendation for additional imaging evaluation includes the
use of spot-compression (with or without magnification), special mammographic views, and
ultrasound. Category 0 should not be used for diagnostic breast imaging findings that warrant
further evaluation with MRI. Rather, the interpreting physician should issue a final assessment in
a report that is made before the MRI examination is performed. Refer to Frequently Asked Ques-
tion #8 in the Guidance chapter for further discussion. [Provide page number for the print
version and an electronic link for the web version.]
```

### FIFTH EDITION — 2013

```
In most circumstances and when feasible, if a mammography examination is not assessed as
negative or benign, the current examination should be compared to prior examination(s). The in-
terpreting physician should use judgment on how vigorously to attempt obtaining prior exami-
nations, given the likelihood of success of such an endeavor and the likelihood that comparison
will affect the final assessment. In this context, it is important to note that comparison to previous
examination(s) may be irrelevant when a finding is inherently suspicious for malignancy.
```
```
Category 0 should be used for prior image comparison only when such comparison is required to
make a final assessment. When category 0 is used in the context of awaiting prior examinations for
comparison, there should be in place a tracking system guaranteeing with 100% reliability that a
final assessment will be made within 30 days (preferably sooner) even if prior examinations do not
become available. Some mammography practices may reasonably choose never to use category
0 in the context of awaiting prior examinations simply because they do not have a 100% reliable
tracking system. If a mammography examination is assessed as category 0 in the context of await-
ing prior examinations and then the prior examinations do become available, an addendum to
the initial mammography report should be issued, including a revised assessment. For auditing
purposes, the revised assessment should replace the initial assessment (see Follow-up and Out-
come Monitoring section).
```
```
b. Mammographic Assessment Is Complete — Final Assessment Categories
Category 1: Negative (See Guidance chapter)
There is nothing to comment on. This is a “normal” examination.
Category 2: Benign (See Guidance chapter)
```
```
Like category 1, this is a “normal” assessment, but here the interpreter chooses to describe a be-
nign finding in the mammography report. Involuting calcified fibroadenomas, skin calcifications,
metallic foreign bodies (such as core biopsy and surgical clips), and fat-containing lesions (such
as oil cysts, lipomas, galactoceles and mixed-density hamartomas) all have characteristically be-
nign appearances and may be described with confidence. The interpreter may also choose to
describe intramammary lymph nodes, vascular calcification, implants, or architectural distortion
clearly related to prior surgery while still concluding that there is no mammographic evidence
of malignancy. On the other hand, the interpreter may choose not to describe such findings, in
which case the examination should be assessed as negative (category 1).
```
```
Note that both category 1 and category 2 assessments indicate that there is no mammographic
evidence of malignancy. Both should be followed by the management recommendation for rou-
tine mammography screening. The difference is that category 2 should be used when describing
one or more specific benign mammographic findings in the report, whereas category 1 should
be used when no such findings are described (even if such findings are present).
```
```
Category 3: Probably Benign (See Guidance chapter, including Figure 149)
A finding assessed using this category should have a ? 2% likelihood of malignancy, but greater
than the essentially 0% likelihood of malignancy of a characteristically benign finding. A prob-
ably benign finding is not expected to change over the suggested period of imaging surveil-
lance, but the interpreting physician prefers to establish stability of the finding before recom-
mending management limited to routine mammography screening.
```
```
There are several prospective clinical studies demonstrating the safety and efficacy of periodic
mammographic surveillance instead of biopsy for specific mammographic findings (7-12). Three
```

### BI-RADS® ATLAS — MAMMOGRAPHY

```
specific findings are validated as being probably benign (noncalcified circumscribed solid mass,
focal asymmetry and solitary group of punctate calcifications). All the previously cited studies
emphasize the need to conduct a complete diagnostic imaging evaluation before making a
probably benign (category 3) assessment; hence it is recommended not to render such an as-
sessment in interpreting a screening mammography examination. The practice of rendering
category 3 assessments directly from screening examination also has been shown to result in
adverse outcomes: [1] unnecessary follow-up of many lesions that could have been promptly
assessed as benign and [2] delayed diagnosis of a small number of cancers that otherwise may
have been smaller in size and less likely to be advanced in stage (13). Also, all the previously cited
studies (7-12) exclude palpable lesions, so the use of a probably benign assessment for a palpable
lesion is not supported by robust scientific data, although there are two single-institution studies
that do report successful outcomes for palpable lesions (14,15). Finally, because evidence from
previously cited studies indicates the need for biopsy rather than continued surveillance when a
probably benign finding increases in size or extent (7-12), it is not prudent to render a category 3
assessment when a finding that otherwise meets “probably benign” imaging criteria is either new
or has increased in size or extent.
```
Refer to Figure 149 at the end of the Guidance chapter for an illustration of the recommended al-
gorithm for follow-up examinations during the entire mammographic surveillance period. **[Pro-
vide page number for the print version and an electronic link for the web version.]** While the
vast majority of probably benign findings are managed with an initial short-interval follow-up (6
months) examination followed by additional examinations until long-term (2- or 3-year) stability
is demonstrated, there may be occasions in which biopsy is done instead (patient preference or
overriding clinical concern).

**Category 4: Suspicious** (See Guidance chapter)

This category is reserved for findings that do not have the classic appearance of malignancy but
are sufficiently suspicious to justify a recommendation for biopsy. The ceiling for category 3 as-
sessment is a 2% likelihood of malignancy and the floor for category 5 assessment is 95%, so cat-
egory 4 assessments cover the wide range of likelihood of malignancy in between. Thus, almost
all recommendations for breast interventional procedures will come from assessments made us-
ing this category. By subdividing category 4 into 4A, 4B, and 4C, as recommended in and using
the cut points indicated in the Guidance chapter, it is hoped that patients and referring clinicians
will more readily make informed decisions on the ultimate course of action.

**Category 5: Highly Suggestive of Malignancy** (See Guidance chapter)

These assessments carry a very high probability (? 95%) of malignancy. This category initially
was established to involve lesions for which 1-stage surgical treatment was considered without
preliminary biopsy, in an era when preoperative wire localization was the primary breast inter-
ventional procedure. Nowadays, given the widespread acceptance of imaging-guided percuta-
neous biopsy, 1-stage surgery rarely if ever is performed. Rather, current oncologic management
almost always involves tissue diagnosis of malignancy via percutaneous tissue sampling, to facili-
tate treatment options such as when sentinel node biopsy is included in surgical management
or when neoadjuvant chemotherapy is administered prior to surgery. Therefore, the current ra-
tionale for using category 5 assessment is to identify lesions for which any non-malignant per-
cutaneous tissue diagnosis is considered discordant, resulting in the recommendation for repeat
(usually surgical) biopsy.


### FIFTH EDITION — 2013

```
Category 6: Known Biopsy-Proven Malignancy (See Guidance chapter):
This category is reserved for examinations performed after biopsy proof of malignancy (im-
aging performed after percutaneous biopsy but prior to complete surgical excision), in which
there are no abnormalities other than the known cancer that might need additional evaluation.
```
**C. WORDING THE REPORT**

```
The current examination should be COMPARED TO PRIOR EXAMINATION(S) when appropriate. The
INDICATION FOR EXAMINATION, such as screening or diagnostic, should be stated. The report should
be organized with a brief description of the COMPOSITION of the breast and any pertinent FIND-
INGS, followed by the ASSESSMENT and MANAGEMENT RECOMMENDATIONS. Any verbal discussions
between the interpreting physician and the referring clinician or patient should be documented in the
original report or in an addendum to the report.
```
```
The report should be succinct, using terminology from the latest approved lexicon without embel-
lishment. Definitions of lexicon terms for mammographic findings should not appear in the report
narrative. Following the impression section and the (concordant) management recommendation
section of the report, both the assessment category number and FDA-approved terminology for
the assessment category should be stated. Other aspects of the report should comply with the ACR
Practice Guideline for Communication: Diagnostic Radiology (16). [Provide an electronic link for
the web version.]

III. GUIDANCE

```
Many substantive changes were incorporated in the Fourth and Fifth Editions to improve the clini-
cal utility of the BI-RADS® Atlas, and to supply a unified base for research involving breast imaging.
This chapter expands on these changes as they appear in each section of the BI-RADS® Atlas and
provides more complete explanations for the changes. What follows is intended for guidance
and is not meant to imply required standards of practice.
```

### FIFTH EDITION — 2013


### BI-RADS® ATLAS — MAMMOGRAPHY

**A. BREAST ULTRASOUND LEXICON**

```
For several findings in the lexicon for which more than one descriptor was used in past editions, only
one descriptor remains in the Fifth Edition. These changes were made to simplify reporting. To ease
the transition, the eliminated descriptor term appears in the heading for each such finding, within
parentheses, as “(historically, <eliminated term>)”. Eliminated terms will appear only in the edition
within which they were eliminated, not in subsequent editions.
```
**1. Asymmetry versus Mass**

```
All types of asymmetry have different border contours than true masses and also lack the conspi-
cuity of masses. Indeed, asymmetries appear similar to other discrete areas of benign fibroglandu-
lar tissue except that they are unilateral, with no mirror-image correlate in the opposite breast. An
asymmetry demonstrates concave-outward borders and usually is interspersed with fat, whereas
a mass demonstrates completely or partially convex-outward borders and (when radiodense) ap-
pears denser in the center than at the periphery. As a descriptor of specific mammographic find-
ings, use of the term “asymmetry” rather than “density” avoids potential confusion, insofar as “den-
sity” also is used to describe the attenuation characteristics of masses.
```
```
There has been only 1 change in the Fifth Edition concerning the lexicon descriptors for masses.
It was confusing in previous editions to have the term “lobular” (2 or 3 large undulations) as a de-
scriptor of shape and the term “microlobulated” (many small undulations) as a descriptor of mar-
gin. Adding to the confusion was the fact that lobular shape usually is associated with a benign
mass whereas a microlobulated margin usually implies a suspicious mass. In the Fifth Edition, the
shape descriptor “lobular” has been eliminated; “microlobulated” remains a descriptor of margin.
The shape of masses with 2 or 3 undulations now are to be described as oval, along with smooth-
contoured elliptical or egg-shaped masses. This change is consistent with the observation that
almost all such “macrolobulated” masses indeed are oval, and also serves to distinguish all oval
masses (usually benign in appearance) from masses with microlobulated margins (which usually
are assessed as suspicious).
```
```
Also concerning masses, it is useful to note that for mammography, descriptors of margin include
the term “obscured” because adjacent dense fibroglandular tissue may impair the visibility of the
margin of a mass. This does not apply to either ultrasound or MRI, which are tomographic modali-
ties that display masses unimpaired by the presence of adjacent dense fibroglandular tissue.
```
**2. Calcifications**

```
In the Fifth Edition, among the descriptors of typically benign calcifications, the term “lucent-cen-
tered” has been eliminated by incorporating it into the remaining term “rim”. The historical term
“eggshell” also has been eliminated, to simplify reporting. This leaves rim calcification as the only
acceptable lexicon term. One reason for these changes is that all the terms describe calcific par-
ticles displaying calcium in the rim and radiolucency in the center. Furthermore, there is no need to
distinguish between different types of rim calcification on the basis of the thickness of the calcified
rim, given that all rim calcifications are typically benign.
```
```
It may be confusing to have both “round” and “punctate” as calcification descriptors when both
refer to particles that are round in shape, but the Fifth Edition emphasizes that these two descrip-
tors have distinguishing features. One difference relates to size, with “punctate” defined as calcific
```

### FIFTH EDITION — 2013

```
particles smaller than 0.5 mm and “round” as particles greater than or equal to 0.5 mm. Another
difference from benign round calcifications is that an isolated group of the smaller, punctate calci-
fications may warrant a probably benign assessment and mammographic surveillance if no prior
examinations are available for comparison, or imaging-guided biopsy if punctate calcifications are
new, increasing, linear, or segmental in distribution, or adjacent to a known cancer.
```
```
“Coarse heterogeneous” calcifications are between 0.5 mm and 1 mm in size and variable in size
and shape, but are smaller than the similarly shaped > 1 mm “dystrophic” calcifications that oc-
cur in response to injury. When present as multiple bilateral groupings, coarse heterogeneous
calcifications are almost always due to fibroadenomas or fibrosis, and benign assessment may
be appropriate. Over time, these tend to coalesce into typically benign calcifications. However,
when present as a solitary isolated group, coarse heterogeneous calcifications have a small but
significant likelihood of malignancy, demonstrating malignancy in slightly fewer than 15% of
cases (see Table 2 , [Lexicon Provide page number for the print version and an electronic
link for the web version.]) , especially when occurring together with even smaller, fine pleomor-
phic calcifications. Among the several types of grouped calcifications that vary in size and shape,
there is a continuum from “fine pleomorphic” to “coarse heterogeneous” to “coarse or popcorn-
like” and “dystrophic”, based on increasing size of the largest, most coalescent calcific particles in
the group. Assessment may be challenging at or close to the cut points for particle size (0.5 mm, 1
mm) between these different types of calcifications. However, within the continuum of variable-
shaped grouped calcifications, the likelihood of malignancy increases as the size of the calcific
particles decreases.
```
```
Another change in the Fifth Edition concerning calcifications involves a clarification of the defini-
tions of “grouped” and “regional” distribution. Problems with the definitions used in previous edi-
tions were: [1] the upper limit in size for “grouped” distribution was 1 cm^3 whereas the lower limit
in size for “regional” distribution was more than 2 cm^3 in size, leaving an unexplained 1 cm^3 gap;
and [2] the sizes for “grouped” and “regional” distribution were described in terms of volume but
interpreting physicians rarely make volume measurements. The Fifth Edition redefines the upper
limit in size for “grouped” distribution as 2 cm while retaining more than 2 cm as the lower limit for
“regional” distribution, eliminating the gap. Furthermore, the Fifth Edition describes the measure-
ment of size in terms of greatest linear dimension, to correspond to the measurement made most
frequently by interpreting physicians.
```
```
However, the major change concerning calcifications in the Fifth Edition is elimination of the sub-
division of suspicious calcifications into groups called “intermediate concern” (amorphous and
coarse heterogeneous) and “higher probability of malignancy” (fine pleomorphic and fine linear
or fine-linear branching). Subsequent to publication of the Fourth Edition, two clinical studies
have been published based on BI-RADS® calcification descriptors (1, 2), the data from which are in-
corporated into Tables 2 and 3 in the Lexicon [Provide page number for the print version and
an electronic link for the web version.] along with two other previously published studies (3,4).
The combination of data from all these studies indicates relatively small differences in the likeli-
hood of malignancy among amorphous, coarse heterogeneous and fine pleomorphic calcifica-
tions, all being substantially lower than 50%. So rather than retaining the previously described
terms “intermediate concern” and “higher probability of malignancy”, the Fifth Edition indicates
that the three calcification types with a lower likelihood of malignancy should be assessed as
category 4B whereas fine linear or fine-linear branching calcifications should be assessed as cat-
egory 4C (see below, in the section on Assessment Categories, for a discussion of the use of sub-
categories of category 4).

**3. Asymmetries**

The BI-RADS® Atlas describes four types of asymmetry: asymmetry, global asymmetry, focal
asymmetry, and developing asymmetry. The term “asymmetry” is used to define a discrete but
asymmetric area of fibroglandular tissue that is visible on only one mammographic projection.
This finding is usually identified at screening mammography, when only one oblique (MLO) and
one craniocaudal view are obtained of each breast. When such a finding reaches the interpreting
physician’s threshold for recall, additional mammographic view(s) should be obtained to estab-
lish or exclude the diagnosis of summation artifact (superimposition of normal breast structures).
This is because research has demonstrated that more than 80% of screening-detected asymme-
tries represent summation artifact (5).

“Global asymmetry” is a real finding (visible on 2 different mammographic projections), in-
volving a large portion of the breast that is defined as at least a quadrant. In the absence
of a palpable correlate, global asymmetry usually is a normal variant or due to contralateral
excision of a large volume of dense fibroglandular tissue, and is assessed as benign (BI-RADS®
category 2) with a recommendation for routine screening.

A “focal asymmetry” differs from global asymmetry only in the volume of the breast involved, oc-
cupying less than a quadrant. Despite its smaller size, focal asymmetry is of more concern than
global asymmetry because a small (especially < 1 cm) focal asymmetry may be nonpalpable yet
malignant. Robust clinical research indicates that there is a 0.5% to 1 % likelihood of malignancy
for a solitary focal asymmetry identified at screening, with no associated architectural distortion,
microcalcifications, or underlying mass identified at subsequent diagnostic mammography and
ultrasound examination (6-11). Therefore, it is reasonable to assess such a finding as probably
benign (BI-RADS® category 3) with a recommendation for short-interval follow-up imaging and
surveillance imaging.

Note that occasionally what is properly described as a focal asymmetry at screening (a finding
visible on standard MLO and CC views) is determined at diagnostic mammography to be two
different findings, each visible on only one standard view (hence, two asymmetries), each of
which ultimately is judged to represent superimposition of normal breast structures. Also, not
infrequently, what is properly described as a focal asymmetry at screening is determined at di-
agnostic evaluation (mammography and/or ultrasound) to represent a mass.

Comparison to previous examination(s) is critical in evaluating asymmetries. Research indicates
an essentially 0% likelihood of malignancy for focal asymmetries that are stable at imaging over
at least a 2-year to 3-year interval (6-11). However, more recent research has demonstrated that
when a focal asymmetry is new or appears larger or more conspicuous than on a previous exami-
nation, the likelihood of malignancy is substantial (12). Based on this evidence, the term “devel-
oping asymmetry” has been added to the lexicon. A developing asymmetry requires additional
imaging evaluation in the absence of a history of surgery, trauma, or infection at the site of the
finding. Unless shown to be characteristically benign (for example, representing a simple cyst at
ultrasound), it is reasonable to assess an unexplained developing asymmetry as suspicious (BI-
RADS® category 4) with a recommendation for tissue diagnosis.

**4. Solitary Dilated Duct**

```
“Solitary dilated duct” is another discrete mammographic finding for which recent research sug-
gests a change in assessment and management from what was recommended previously (13).
```

### FIFTH EDITION — 2013

```
Although rarely encountered, the frequency of malignancy is reported to be approximately 10%
when a solitary dilated duct is identified (without associated mass, architectural distortion or
microcalcifications). Therefore, although previous editions of the BI-RADS® Atlas indicated that
this finding is usually of minor clinical significance, one should now consider additional imaging
evaluation leading to tissue diagnosis unless a benign etiology is demonstrated.
```
**5. Breast Composition**

```
The Fifth Edition eliminates quartile ranges of percent dense tissue to define the descriptors of
breast composition, reflecting the clinical experience that interpreting physicians did not use
the quartile ranges that were introduced in the Fourth Edition. Documentation of this clinical
experience and a full discussion of the rationale behind eliminating quartile ranges is found in
the breast composition portion of the Reporting System. [Provide page number for the print
version and an electronic link for the web version.]
```
**6. Descriptors for Lesion Location**

```
The Fifth Edition expands the descriptors used to describe lesion location, allowing for more
precision in indicating the site(s) of abnormal finding(s). This facilitates correlation of what is seen
at mammography with the findings at other breast imaging modalities and at clinical breast
examination.
```
**7. Comparison to Previous Examinations**

```
The Fifth Edition adds the statement that comparison to previous examination(s) may be ir-
relevant when a finding is inherently suspicious for malignancy, serving as recognition of the
clinical reality that subsequent management should be based on current rather than previ-
ous imaging findings. This provides justification for simplifying abnormal reports by omitting
comments about the presence or absence of interval change for findings that clearly require
prompt action.
```
**8. Use of Radiopaque Markers**
A raised skin lesion sufficiently large to be seen at mammography may be marked by the tech-
    nologist with a radiopaque device designed for use as a marker for a skin lesion. Because this
    marker is placed directly on top of or surrounding the skin lesion, both the device and the skin
    lesion will be seen in the same location on mammographic images obtained in any projection.
    This approach enables the interpreting physician to discount the importance of the underlying
    mammographic finding, which represents the benign skin lesion.

```
Similarly, the technologist may use a radiopaque device to mark the location of a palpable le-
sion in the breast. The technologist should place the marker at the location on the skin that is ex-
pected to overlie the palpable lesion when the breast is compressed in a given mammographic
projection (14). Visibility of the marker on the mammogram may serve as an indicator that the
palpable lesion has been included in the image field. This approach also assists the interpreting
physician in correlating the presence or absence of any visible mammographic finding(s) with
the palpable lesion. However, the deeper within the breast that a palpable lesion is located, the
greater the likelihood that the marker will be projected distant from the palpable lesion, poten-
tially confounding mammographic interpretation. For this reason, it is recommended that the
technologist remove the marker after the first exposure and replace it at another location on the
```

### BI-RADS® ATLAS — MAMMOGRAPHY

```
skin so as to overlie the palpable lesion when the next exposure is obtained in a different mam-
mographic projection.
```
```
Finally, because the clinical significance of a palpable lesion is greater than that of a raised skin
lesion, because the radiopaque devices used to mark both palpable and skin lesions are available
in several different shapes, and because there has been no consensus in establishing the use of
specific-shaped markers to represent palpable versus skin lesions, the following two practices are
recommended.
? To properly inform interpreting physicians within a given mammography facility, the facility
should adopt a policy requiring consistent use of two different shapes of radiopaque devices
for palpable and skin lesions, respectively.
? To properly inform interpreting physicians outside the facility, there should be an indication
of the type of underlying lesion marked by every radiopaque device (palpable versus skin le-
sion), either as a permanent annotation on the appropriate mammographic image(s) or as a
description in the mammography report.
```
**B. REPORT ORGANIZATION**

**1. Assessment-Management Concordance**

```
In previous editions of the BI-RADS® Atlas, management recommendations were included in the
text used to describe several of the assessment categories. In the Fifth Edition, we have removed
the management recommendations from this text in order to provide more flexibility for several
specific clinical scenarios (described in detail in the immediately subsequent paragraphs) for
which a seemingly discordant management recommendation might be appropriate for a giv-
en assessment. However, except for these few scenarios, the management recommendation
should be fully concordant with the assessment, as indicated in Table 7. Assessment-manage-
ment concordance is a hallmark of appropriate interpretation. To do otherwise invites confusing
the referring clinician and/or the patient, with the potential for producing incorrect treatment.
```
```
The most common clinical scenario in which the appropriate management recommendation
may appear to be discordant with the proper BI-RADS® assessment category occurs when
there are no imaging findings in a patient who has a palpable breast abnormality. In this situ-
ation, it would seem that the breast imaging report should indicate a negative (BI-RADS® cat-
egory 1) assessment, because there are indeed no imaging findings to describe. However,
to cover the possibility that a palpable cancer might not be visible at breast imaging, the
interpreting physician may want to suggest surgical consultation or tissue diagnosis, man-
agement recommendations that are discordant with a negative assessment. The correct ap-
proach to reporting in this scenario is to provide a negative (BI-RADS® category 1) assessment
with a concordant management recommendation for routine mammography screening, but
to follow this with a sentence recommending surgical consultation or tissue diagnosis if clini-
cally indicated. The presence of certain other mammographically occult clinical findings also
may require a recommendation for prompt action by the referring clinician, such as suspected
Paget disease of the nipple without a suspicious finding at imaging and a skin lesion suspect
for melanoma or skin cancer.
```

### FIFTH EDITION — 2013

```
Another seemingly discordant clinical scenario involves the simple (characteristically benign)
cyst that is either tender or painful, for which therapeutic aspiration is recommended for symp-
tomatic relief, given that the recommendation for an interventional procedure is discordant with
a benign assessment. The correct approach to reporting in this scenario is to provide a benign
(BI-RADS® category 2) assessment with a concordant management recommendation for routine
mammography screening, but to follow this with a sentence recommending aspiration to relieve
the discomfort produced by the cyst.
```
```
Still another scenario that involves an assessment-management discordance occurs in the wom-
an who has a ruptured implant but no imaging findings suggestive of malignancy. The seem-
ingly appropriate benign assessment would be discordant with a recommendation for surgical
consultation leading to implant removal and possible replacement with a new implant. The cor-
rect approach to reporting in this scenario is to provide a benign (BI-RADS® category 2) assess-
ment with a concordant management recommendation for routine mammography screening,
but to follow this with a sentence recommending surgical consultation that addresses proper
treatment for the ruptured implant. The presence of certain other benign imaging findings also
may require a recommendation for prompt action by the referring clinician, such as breast ab-
scess, edema of the breast (when not suspicious for malignancy), new hematoma, new clinically
relevant foreign body, and some manifestations of gynecomastia in a male patient.
```
```
It should be clear from the previous examples that the correct approach to reporting for all seem-
ingly discordant interpretive scenarios is [a] that the assessment category should reflect the im-
aging findings of the case, [b] that a concordant management recommendation should be pro-
vided for this assessment, but [c] that an additional sentence should recommend the additional
(apparently discordant) management appropriate for the scenario. This approach provides the
flexibility in reporting to allow for both concordant and discordant components of management
to be associated with the imaging-appropriate assessment.
```
**2. Assessment When More than One Breast Imaging Examination is Report-**
    **ed Together**

```
BI-RADS® initially was designed as a mammographic tool. Beginning with the Fourth Edition, BI-
RADS® Mammography was combined with BI-RADS® Ultrasound and BI-RADS® MRI. Obviously,
both ultrasound and MRI have features that are unique to each imaging modality but, when
possible, the same lexicon descriptors that are used for mammography also are employed for ul-
trasound and MRI. In the Fifth Edition, one change has been made in the mammography section,
so that all three sections use the same terminology whenever possible. Specifically, the mam-
mography section has been changed to add distance from the nipple as a descriptor of lesion
location, to parallel the descriptors used in the Ultrasound and MRI sections. Note that the goal
here is simply to provide an additional location descriptor for mammographic lesions; it is recog-
nized that distance from the nipple is likely to vary somewhat among the different breast imag-
ing modalities because the breast is compressed at mammography and the patient is supine at
ultrasound and prone at MRI.
```
```
The terms used for assessment categories and management recommendations are the same for
all imaging modalities. When more than one type of examination is performed concurrently (on
the same day), it is preferable that the examinations be reported together, with the findings for
each examination described in separate paragraphs, with an overall assessment and manage-
```

### BI-RADS® ATLAS — MAMMOGRAPHY

```
ment recommendations for the combined examinations. In general, when the assessments for
two examinations differ, the overall assessment (and concordant management recommenda-
tions) should reflect the more abnormal of the individual assessments, according to the following
hierarchy of increasing abnormality: category 1, 2, 3, 6, 0, 4, 5.
```
```
Exceptions to this rule occur when the characteristically benign features of a given imaging
finding on one examination supersede the less specifically benign features of the same find-
ing on the other examination (for example, partially circumscribed noncalcified mass at mam-
mography, superseded by simple cyst at ultrasound). These exceptions are described in detail
in the section on frequently asked questions that appears later in this chapter.

```
Table 7. Abnormality Hierarchy
```
**C. ASSESSMENT CATEGORIES**

```
BI-RADS® assessments are divided into incomplete (category 0) and final assessment categories
(categories 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6). An incomplete mammography assessment, usually rendered at batch-
read screening mammography, requires further evaluation with additional mammographic views,
ultrasound, and/or comparison mammography examination(s). If the additional evaluation involves
only comparison with previous mammography examination(s) that then leads to a final assessment,
the incomplete screening assessment is replaced by this final assessment. If the additional evalu-
ation includes a diagnostic imaging examination, a final assessment is rendered for the diagnostic
examination, but the screening mammography examination remains assessed as category 0.
```
```
The Mammography Quality Standards Act (MQSA) requires that a single assessment be rendered
for every mammographic examination. Mammography facilities that wish to provide an assessment
separately for each breast may do so within the impression or body of the report, provided that a
single overall assessment for the examination is clearly stated at the end of the entire report. This
overall assessment should be based on the assessment rendered for the more abnormal of the two
breasts, based on the same hierarchy of increasing abnormality described previously (category 1,
2, 3, 6, 0, 4, 5). For example, if there is a probably benign assessment for one breast and a suspi-
cious assessment for the opposite breast, the overall assessment should be suspicious (BI-RADS®
category 4). Note that in July 2003 the FDA approved an alternative standard that allows for the
separate assessment of findings for each breast without the need to also provide an overall assess-
```

### FIFTH EDITION — 2013

```
ment (15). [http://www.fda.gov/RadiationEmittingProducts/MammographyQualityStandardsAC-
TandProgram/Regualtions/ucm259286.] The conditions for use of this alternative standard are that:
```
```
[a] a single medical report for both breasts will be sent to the referring clinician (or to the patient
if there is no referring clinician),
```
```
[b] a single lay report will be sent to the patient, containing information based on what would
have been the overall assessment for both breasts; and
```
```
[c] even though separate assessments are made for each breast, the interpretation will count as
only one examination towards meeting the MQSA experience requirements and will be billed
as a single examination.
```
```
The following paragraphs explain in detail the proper use of the several BI-RADS® assessment
categories.
```
**1. Categories 1 and 2**

```
The use of assessment categories 1 and 2 (negative and benign, respectively) has been fur-
ther clarified in the lexicon of the Fifth Edition. Both of these categories are associated with
the same management recommendation, routine mammography screening. The difference is
that category 1 should be used when no specific benign findings are described in the text of
the report, whereas category 2 should be used when at least one benign finding is described.
Note that this difference relates to whether or not benign findings are described in the report,
not on whether such findings are visible at examination. Some radiologists prefer to describe
certain benign findings while others do not, so it is possible for the same examination (or un-
changed examinations) to be assessed as either category 1 or 2. Because it may be confusing
for the referring clinician or patient who reads a report that indicates no interval change from
previous examination but includes a current category 1 versus previous category 2 assess-
ment, or vice versa, it is recommended that all radiologists who work at a given mammogra-
phy facility collectively agree on whether and when to describe benign findings in the report,
hence when to use category 2 versus category 1.
```
**2. Category 3**

```
The use of assessment category 3, probably benign, has been clarified in the lexicon of the Fifth
Edition. It is emphasized that this is NOT an indeterminate category used simply when the radiolo-
gist is unsure whether to render a benign (BI-RADS® category 2) or suspicious (BI-RADS® category
4) assessment, but one that is reserved for specific imaging findings known to have a greater than
essentially 0% but ? 2% likelihood of representing malignancy. For mammography, there is robust
literature describing three findings (noncalcified circumscribed solid mass, focal asymmetry, and
solitary group of punctate calcifications) that have likelihoods of malignancy in the defined (? 2%)
probably-benign range, for which short-interval (6-month) follow-up mammography and then
periodic mammographic surveillance represents appropriate management (6-11). Use of assess-
ment category 3 for mammographic findings other than these three should be considered only if
the radiologist has personal experience to justify a watchful-waiting approach, preferably involving
observation of a sufficient number of cases of an additional mammographic finding to suggest a
likelihood of malignancy within the defined (? 2%) probably-benign range. Two large-scale studies
performed in the United States have validated that in the usual-care setting, category 3 assess-
ments indeed are associated with a likelihood of malignancy of < 2% (16,17).
```

### BI-RADS® ATLAS — MAMMOGRAPHY

The Fifth Edition also emphasizes the recommendation that category 3 assessments should
be made only after completion of a full diagnostic breast imaging examination, rather than at
screening mammography. There are 2 major advantages to the recommended approach. [1]
More prompt identification of truly benign findings (simple cysts, some intramammary lymph
nodes, some cases of grouped skin calcifications, etc). A large-scale BCSC study has shown that
recall imaging significantly increases the identification of characteristically benign lesions, thus
promptly establishing a benign diagnosis, reducing anxiety, and obviating short-interval fol-
low-up examination (17). [2] More prompt identification of some rapidly growing cancers. The
same BCSC study also suggested that recall imaging leads to the prompt diagnosis of some ag-
gressively growing cancers by identifying these tumors when they are smaller and more likely
to be node-negative, rather than 6 months later at initial short-interval follow-up examination
(17). Discouraging the use of category 3 assessments at screening mammography is not lim-
ited to BI-RADS® recommendations. The first pay-for-performance initiative within Medicare’s
Physician Quality Reporting System (PQRS) that concerns breast imaging involves reporting the
percentage of screening mammography examinations that are assessed as category 3, with the
stated goal of reducing this to “approaching 0%” in clinical practice (18).

For category 3 assessments, the initial short-term follow-up interval is usually 6 months, involv-
ing the breast(s) containing the probably benign finding(s). Assuming stability at this 6-month
examination, a category 3 assessment again will be rendered with a management recommen-
dation for a second short-interval follow-up examination in 6 months, but now involving both
breasts if the opposite breast will be due for routine annual screening. Again assuming stability
at this second short-interval follow-up, the examination is once more assessed as category 3,
but now the recommended follow-up interval usually is lengthened to 1 year due the already-
observed 12-month stability. Note that although 1-year follow-up coincides with the routine
screening interval in the United States, a category 3 assessment still should be rendered, to indi-
cate that the period of mammographic surveillance is still underway. According to the literature
(6), after 2 to 3 years of stability, the final assessment category should be changed to benign (BI-
RADS® category 2), although diagnostic (rather than screening) follow-up may be appropriate
if, for example, continued spot-compression magnification views will be needed. A flow-chart
algorithm describing appropriate protocols for short-interval follow-up and surveillance mam-
mography for category 3 assessments is presented in Figure 149.

Note that at any short-interval or surveillance mammography examination, if the probably benign
lesion is seen to decrease or disappear, the appropriate assessment is benign (BI-RADS® category
2) or negative (BI-RADS® category 1), respectively, accompanied by a recommendation for routine
mammography screening. Also, it may be appropriate for a more experienced interpreter of a
follow-up examination to render a benign or negative rather than probably benign assessment
for a stable finding that he/she recognizes as being characteristically benign or a normal variant.
Also, one may encounter the scenario where patient or referring clinician concern causes a prob-
ably benign finding to be biopsied. In this potentially confusing scenario, the correct approach
to reporting is to render a probably benign (BI-RADS® category 3) assessment with a concordant
management recommendation for short-interval or surveillance mammography, but to follow
this with a sentence indicating that tissue diagnosis will be performed instead, due to patient or
referring clinician concern. Finally, one may encounter the scenario of a developing asymmetry
or similar suspicious finding in the clinical setting of recent breast trauma or suspected infection,
causing the interpreting physician to recommend repeat mammography in 1 month rather than

prompt biopsy. In this potentially confusing scenario, the correct approach is to render a suspi-
cious (BI-RADS® category 4) assessment rather than a probably benign (BI-RADS® category 3) as-
sessment, with a concordant management recommendation for biopsy followed by additional
text indicating that biopsy will be deferred for 1 month, at which time it will be performed un-
less pre-biopsy mammography shows interval resolution of the suspicious finding. These last two
scenarios are yet other examples of how, by removing management recommendations from the
text of BI-RADS® assessment categories, we have provided the needed flexibility to allow for both
the concordant and discordant components of management to be associated with an imaging-
appropriate assessment, as well as to produce accurate medical audit data for the interpreting
physician’s performance.
```
```
There is still another reason for eliminating management recommendations from the text of
BI-RADS® assessment categories. Consider the potential confusion if the Fourth-Edition termi-
nology “probably benign short-interval follow-up recommended” were used for a 12-month
follow-up category 3 assessment that appropriately is accompanied by a management recom-
mendation of 1-year follow-up. By using Fifth-Edition terminology (“probably benign”), there
is no apparent discordance with the recommendation for 1-year surveillance mammography.
```
**3. Category 4**

```
Category 4 is used for the vast majority of findings prompting breast interventional procedures,
ranging from diagnostic aspiration of complicated cysts to biopsy of fine-linear and branching
calcifications. According to BI-RADS® definitions expressed in terms of likelihood of malignancy,
the cut points between category 3 versus category 4 assessments and category 4 versus cat-
egory 5 assessments are 2% and 95%, respectively. Many institutions have, on an individual ba-
sis, subdivided category 4 to account for the vast range of lesions subjected to interventional
procedures and corresponding broad range of likelihood of malignancy. This allows a more
meaningful practice audit, is useful in research involving receiver-operating characteristic (ROC)
curve analysis, and is an aid for clinicians and pathologists. The optional division of category 4
into three subdivisions, internally at the facility level, helps to accomplish these goals.
```
```
Since the publication of the Fourth Edition, in which subdivision of category 4 assessments was
proposed, several articles have been published that support this approach (2,19,20). We believe
that the scientific literature is now sufficiently strong to indicate specific cut points for the sub-
divisions of category 4 assessments, and encourage future research to validate the clinical rel-
evance of using these cut points.
```
**4. Category 4A**

```
Category 4A may be used for a finding needing intervention but with a low suspicion for malig-
nancy. A malignant finding is not expected and a recommendation for 6-month or routine follow-
up after a benign percutaneous tissue diagnosis is appropriate. The range of likelihood of malig-
nancy for category 4A assessments is > 2% to ? 10%. Examples of findings placed in this category
may include a partially (< 75%) circumscribed solid mass with ultrasound features suggestive of a
fibroadenoma, palpable solitary complicated cyst and probable abscess. solitary complicated cyst
and probable abscess. Some particularly risk-tolerant patients may even choose to decline recom-
mended biopsy for category 4A lesions, if they are willing to accept the risk that up to 10% of such
lesions actually are malignant
```

### FIFTH EDITION — 2013

**5. Category 4B**

```
Category 4B includes lesions with a moderate suspicion of malignancy. Findings in this category
warrant careful radiologic and pathologic correlation after percutaneous tissue diagnosis. Recom-
mended follow-up with a benign result will depend on concordance. The range of likelihood of
malignancy for category 4Bassessments is > 10% to ? 50%. Examples of findings placed in this
category may include a group of amorphous or fine pleomorphic calcifications and an otherwise
nondescript solid mass with indistinct margin (see illustrations on pages xx, xx, and xx — THE
MAMMOGRAPHY LEXICON — For amorphous calcifications, use Figures 1 and 2 that are on page
49(?); for fine pleomorphic calcifications, use Figures 1 and 2 that are on page 53(?); and for mass
with indistinct margin, use Figure 1 on page 24(?) (unless, within the ultrasound section, there is
one or more similar examples that also show the masses to be solid.]
```
**6. Category 4C**

```
Category 4C includes findings that have a high suspicion of malignancy but that are not highly
suggestive of malignancy (category 5). The range of likelihood of malignancy for category 4C as-
sessments is > 50% to < 95% more likely malignant than benign and therefore properly termed
“high suspicion”. Examples of findings placed in this category are a new indistinct, irregular solid
mass and a new group of fine linear calcifications. [For indistinct irregular solid mass, use Figures 4
and 5 on page 25(?) (unless, within the ultrasound section, there is one or more similar examples
that also show the masses to be solid); for fine linear calcifications, use Figures 1 and 2 that are on
page 55(?) of this document.]
```
```
Given the consistent use of the subdivisions of category 4, pathologists may initiate further his-
tological evaluation of benign results for category 4C lesions, and the referring clinician may be
better able to understand the radiology follow-up recommendations for findings placed in each
subdivision of category 4.
```
```
Also note that whereas the Fourth Edition indicated the terse and somewhat vague “consider
biopsy” as management for all category 4 assessments, the Fifth Edition provides the more di-
rected management recommendation, “biopsy should be performed in the absence of clini-
cal contraindication”. This new text unequivocally specifies tissue diagnosis as the interpreting
physician’s management recommendation for category 4 assessments, appropriately and ef-
fectively transferring the burden of establishing a contraindication to this recommendation to
the referring clinician.
```
```
Refer to Frequently Asked Question #4 later in this section for further discussion of FDA regulations
concerning the use of subdivisions of Category 4.
```
**7. Category 5**

```
Category 5, highly suggestive of malignancy, was established at a time when most nonpalpable
breast lesions underwent preoperative wire localization prior to surgical excision. Category 5 as-
sessments were used for those lesions that had such characteristic features of cancer that 1-stage
surgical treatment might be performed immediately following frozen-section histological confir-
mation of malignancy. Today breast cancer diagnosis for imaging-detected lesions almost always
involves percutaneous tissue sampling, so the current rationale for using category 5 assessment
is to identify lesions for which any nonmalignant percutaneous tissue diagnosis is considered

discordant, resulting in the recommendation for repeat (usually surgical) biopsy.
```
```
The likelihood of malignancy for category 5 assessments is ? 95%, so use of this assessment cat-
egory is reserved for classic examples of malignancy. Examples of findings placed in this category
are an irregular, spiculated, high density mass with associated microcalcifications and new fine
linear and branching calcifications in segmental distribution. Note that there is no single mam-
mographic feature that is associated with a likelihood of malignancy of ? 95%. Just as is found
for breast ultrasound and MRI examinations, it takes a combination of suspicious imaging findings
to justify a category 5 assessment.
```
```
Also note that whereas the Fourth Edition simply indicated as management that “appropriate
action should be taken” for category 5 assessments, the Fifth Edition provides the more directed
management recommendation, “biopsy should be performed in the absence of clinical contra-
indication”. As for category 4 assessments, this new text unequivocally specifies tissue diagno-
sis as the interpreting physician’s management recommendation for category 5 assessments,
appropriately and effectively transferring the burden of establishing a contraindication to this
recommendation to the referring clinician.
```
**8. Category 6**

```
This assessment category was added to the Fourth Edition for use in the special circumstance
when breast imaging is performed after a tissue diagnosis of malignancy but prior to complete
surgical excision. Unlike the more common situations when BI-RADS® categories 4 and 5 are used,
a category 6 assessment will not be associated with recommendation for tissue diagnosis of the
target lesion because biopsy already has established the presence of malignancy. Category 6 is
the appropriate assessment, prior to complete surgical excision, for second opinions of previously
biopsied findings already shown to be malignant, after attempted complete removal of the target
lesion by percutaneous core biopsy, and for the monitoring of response to neoadjuvant chemo-
therapy.
```
```
Category 6 also should be used for breast imaging examinations performed after attempted com-
plete surgical excision when the pathology report indicates positive resection margins, given the
assumption that residual tumor is present. The purpose of breast imaging in this situation is to
indicate the specific location of any area(s) suspicious for residual tumor that should be included
in planned re-excision, not to help determine whether re-excision is needed. The use of category
6 is appropriate because additional surgery likely will be performed anyway, even in the absence
of suspicious breast imaging findings. However, a category 6 assessment is appropriate in this
scenario only if there is at least one mammographic feature suggestive of residual tumor. On the
other hand, if there are no mammographic findings other than those indicating postsurgical scar-
ring, a benign (BI-RADS® category 2) assessment should be rendered, supplemented by an extra
sentence stating that the pathology report suggests the possibility of residual tumor despite the
absence of a mammographic correlate, this latter circumstance representing still another assess-
ment-management discordance for which the assessment should reflect the imaging findings,
with an additional management recommendation to cover the discordance.
```
```
Also note that whereas the Fourth Edition simply indicated as management that “appropriate
action should be taken” for category 6 assessments, the Fifth Edition provides the more directed
management recommendation, “surgical excision when clinically appropriate”. This new text
unequivocally specifies surgical excision as subsequent management, also taking into account
```

### FIFTH EDITION — 2013

```
the clinical reality that the timing of excision (when clinically appropriate) will be determined by
someone other than the interpreting physician.
```
```
A category 6 assessment should not be rendered in several clinical scenarios in which patients
with known biopsy proven malignancy have breast imaging examinations. For example, the use
of category 6 is not appropriate for breast imaging examinations performed following surgical
excision of a malignancy (lumpectomy) when the pathology report indicates no tumor at the
margins of resection. In this clinical setting, tissue diagnosis will not be performed unless breast
imaging demonstrates residual or new suspicious findings. Therefore, if a postlumpectomy ex-
amination demonstrates surgical scarring but no visible residual malignancy, the appropriate as-
sessment is benign (BI-RADS® category 2). On the other hand, if there are, for example, residual or
new suspicious calcifications, the appropriate assessment is category 4 or 5.
```
```
There is one other potentially confusing situation involving the use of assessment category 6. This
occurs when, prior to complete surgical excision of a biopsy-proven malignancy, breast imaging
demonstrates one or more possibly suspicious findings other than the known cancer. Because
subsequent management should first evaluate the as yet undetermined finding(s), involving ad-
ditional imaging, imaging-guided tissue diagnosis or both, it must be made clear that besides
the known malignancy there is one or more finding requiring specific prompt action. The single
overall assessment should be based on the most immediate action needed. Therefore, if a second-
opinion report is being made and additional imaging is indicated, a category 0 assessment should
be rendered and the recommended work-up should be specified. If a finding or findings are
identified for which tissue diagnosis is recommended, then a category 4 or 5 assessment should
be rendered. If at additional imaging for finding(s) other than the known malignancy, it is deter-
mined that tissue diagnosis is not appropriate, then a category 6 assessment should be rendered
accompanied by the recommendation that subsequent management now should be directed
to the cancer. As for any examination in which there is more than one finding, the management
section of the report may include a second sentence that describes the appropriate management
for the finding(s) not covered by the overall assessment.
```
```
Note that, as described in the Follow-up and Outcome Monitoring chapter, examinations with
category 6 assessment should not be included in breast imaging audits. Because the diagnosis of
malignancy already has been established, inclusion of these cases would skew the data for many
performance parameters, confounding the interpretation of audit results.
```
**9. Category 0**

```
Category 0 is utilized primarily in reporting batch-read screening mammography examina-
tions. It is used to indicate the recommendation for additional imaging evaluation, for retrieval
of previous examinations for comparison, or for “technical repeat” examination. A recommenda-
tion for additional imaging evaluation includes the use of spot-compression (with or without
magnification), special mammographic views, and ultrasound.
```
```
Unlike all previous editions, the Fifth Edition discourages the use of category 4 or 5 assessments
at screening, instead recommending that all abnormal screening reports utilize assessment cat-
egory 0 (incomplete – need additional imaging evaluation). This new recommendation more
closely reflects the binary nature of screening assessments (positive versus negative) and man-
agement recommendations (routine screening versus prompt action). Note that the presence of
```

### BI-RADS® ATLAS — MAMMOGRAPHY

findings at screening that are sufficiently abnormal to justify tissue diagnosis does not eliminate
the need for diagnostic breast imaging evaluation to more accurately indicate the extent of dis-
ease prior to biopsy. Indeed, the use of category 0 assessments in this clinical scenario maximizes
the likelihood that appropriate additional diagnostic imaging will be performed prior to tissue
diagnosis. The use of category 0 assessments for all abnormal screening examinations also will
serve to clarify that the abnormal interpretation (recall) rate should reflect even those screening
examinations with findings sufficiently abnormal to justify tissue diagnosis.

While comparison to previous examinations is known to decrease the frequency of recall (21,22),
comparison is not required for most mammography examinations. In the absence of any con-
cerning findings, it was found that previous examinations were helpful in only 35 of 1093 (3.2%)
cases (23). Therefore, category 0 assessment should be used for previous image comparison only
when such comparison is required to make a final assessment. Most frequently, this would in-
volve examinations that display a focal asymmetry that could be dismissed as either a normal
variant or benign finding by demonstration of stability.

Also note that the Fifth Edition contains a caution, not present in the Fourth Edition, on the use
of category 0 assessments when awaiting prior mammograms for comparison. This caution em-
phasizes that the mammography facility utilizing such assessments should have in place a track-
ing system guaranteeing with 100% reliability that a more directive assessment will be made
within 30 days (preferably sooner) even if prior examinations do not become available.

Further note that the Fifth Edition contains another caution, absent in the Fourth Edition, that
category 0 assessments should not be utilized for diagnostic breast imaging findings that war-
rant further evaluation with MRI. Rather, in this clinical scenario the interpreting physician should
utilize one of the final assessment categories in a report that is made before the MRI examination
is performed. Refer to Frequently Asked Question #8 for a more complete discussion of this issue.

**D. FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS**

**1. Under MQSA, is it necessary to include a numeric assessment code (i.e., 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6) in**
    **addition to the assessment category in all mammography reports?**

```
No. FDA regulations require only that each mammography report include the text correspond-
ing to the overall assessment category, not the numeric code. These categories are “Incom-
plete: Need Additional Imaging Evaluation”, “Negative”, “Benign”, “Probably Benign”, “Suspicious”,
“Highly Suggestive of Malignancy” and “Known Biopsy-Proven Cancer”. The FDA requires that
the assessment category be written verbatim as described in their regulations (limited flexibility
is allowed, using equivalent wording as detailed in the table below). Use of any wording not
specifically listed in the table would be in violation of FDA regulations. Also, the FDA has
approved an alternative standard to allow the assessment category “Post Procedure Mammo-
grams for Marker Placement”. Although the ACR encourages the use of numeric codes along
with the assessment category text, there are no requirements that the codes be assigned to
their respective assessments.
```
**2. Is there a new numeric code in BI-RADS® for “Post Procedure Mammograms for Marker**
    **Placement”?**

```
No. There is no numeric code for the FDA-approved alternative standard for “Post Procedure
Mammograms for Marker Placement”. This is not even a BI-RADS® final assessment category.
This assessment may be used only for post-procedure mammograms obtained for the purpose
of confirming the deployment and position of breast tissue markers, which typically have been
placed at the time of core biopsy. In addition, this assessment should be excluded from auditing.
Note that there is no FDA-approved equivalent wording for this assessment category other than
“Post Procedure Mammograms for Marker Placement”.

**3. In my practice we commonly issue addenda and/or comparison reports after initial mammog-**
    **raphy reports have been issued. Are we required to provide a final assessment category with**
    **each of these reports? Must we also send the addendum or comparison report to the referring**
    **health care provider and a letter to the patient, even if there is no change in the final assess-**
    **ment category or recommended course of action?**

```
Yes, to both questions. FDA regulations require that the report issued after additional mammogra-
phy (i.e., repeat, spot-compression, magnification, other additional views) or following comparison
with prior mammography examinations must provide a final assessment category for the case. A
report must be communicated to the referring health care provider or the self-referred patient. In
addition, a lay summary of the addendum or comparison report must be provided to the patient,
even if there is no change in the final assessment category or recommended course of action. For
the specific case in which there is no significant change in a comparison report, a simple statement
that the comparison has been performed and that there is no overall change (ensuring to include
the unchanged final assessment) would satisfy the requirement, accompanied by a comparison
lay summary informing the patient of that fact. For the specific case in which an addendum report
is issued that simply states that the referring health care provider has been notified of the results of
the patient’s examination, then the addendum lay summary may be a simple statement informing
the patient of that fact.
```
**4. My practice uses the BI-RADS® category 4 subdivisions (4A – low suspicion, 4B – moderate sus-**
    **picion, 4C – high suspicion). May our reports use these subdivisions as assessment categories**
    **instead of the category 4 assessment (suspicious)?**
No. While you have the option of using one of the three subdivisions of category 4 in addition to
    a final assessment of “Suspicious”, the FDA will not allow you to use the subcategories instead of
    the “Suspicious” assessment category in the mammography report.


### BI-RADS® ATLAS — MAMMOGRAPHY

**5. Do mammography examinations performed on men require a BI-RADS® final assessment and/**
    **or numeric code?**

Yes. All mammography examinations, regardless of the patient’s gender, are required to have a final
assessment category (not a numeric code) in the mammography report. However, management rec-
ommendations may differ from those made for women because annual screening mammography is
not usually appropriate for men.

**6. Under Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) guidelines, we may now charge for**
    **screening and diagnostic mammography examinations done on the same patient on the**
    **same day. May we combine the two examinations into one report or must we issue two sepa-**
    **rate reports?**

The mammography facility has the option of issuing either separate or combined reports. (You
may want to check with your billing office; some third-party payers may require individual re-
ports.) If two reports are issued, each must contain its own overall final assessment. The facility
may report both examinations on the “same piece of paper”. If the facility decides to issue a single
combined report, the facility needs to be aware of the following:
[1] A single combined report must contain a single overall final assessment.
[2] The combined report should make it clear to the referring clinician that it is combining the re-
sults of the screening and diagnostic studies. This is also important if questions ever arise about
whether the examinations were billed correctly.
[3] It is critical to understand that issuing a single report with a single final assessment will skew
the facility’s audit results, unless (recommended) the examination is audited as both screen-
ing category 0 and diagnostic using the final assessment category rendered.
[4] Although some computerized reporting systems may consider this a single examination
(rather than two), FDA would still allow the facility to count both examinations toward meet-
ing the continuing experience requirement of the interpreting physician.

**7. If the final assessment of a screening mammography examination is “Incomplete” (BI-RADS®**
    **category 0) and the woman then undergoes additional imaging evaluation, does the FDA re-**
    **quire the mammography facility to revise or amend the original report if, as a result of the**
    **additional imaging, the assessment is changed to any of the final assessment categories?**

First, for auditing purposes, the original screening assessment must remain category 0. However,
if the additional imaging includes mammography (and therefore is covered under MQSA), the
facility performing these additional mammographic views also **must** issue a report (either sepa-
rately or as an addendum to the original mammography report) that reflects the final assessment.
The BI-RADS® Atlas provides further recommendations on this topic. “When more than one type
of [diagnostic] examination is performed concurrently (on the same day), it is **preferable** that
the examinations be reported together, with the findings for each examination described in a
separate paragraph, with separate assessments for each examination followed by **an overall as-
sessment and management recommendations for the combined examinations** .”

**8. A screening mammography examination received an “Incomplete” (BI-RADS** ® **category 0) as-**
    **sessment due to an asymmetry. The subsequent diagnostic mammography examination is**
    **also assessed as BI-RADS** ® **category 0, recommending additional ultrasound examination.**
    **An ultrasound examination then is performed showing no abnormal findings, but I want to**


### FIFTH EDITION — 2013

```
further evaluate this patient with MRI, which occasionally depicts a cancer not seen at either
mammography or ultrasound. Is it appropriate to also assess the ultrasound examination as
BI-RADS ® category 0, recommend additional MRI examination?
```
```
This question involves two non-recommended uses of BI-RADS® category 0. First, with few un-
common exceptions, category 0 should not be used for diagnostic mammography examinations.
Therefore, if diagnostic mammography is performed concurrently with ultrasound, an overall BI-
RADS® assessment category should be given (rather than a category 0 assessment for the mam-
mography followed by a category 1 assessment for the ultrasound). The overall assessment would
depend on the mammographic and sonographic findings and whether these are or are not de-
scribed in the diagnostic breast imaging report. Refer to the following examples.
? If no findings are described in either the mammography or ultrasound portions of a com-
bined report, the appropriate overall assessment is negative (BI-RADS® category 1).
? If one or more specific benign findings are described in either the mammography or ul-
trasound portions of a combined report, the appropriate overall assessment is benign (BI-
RADS® category 2).
? If diagnostic mammography depicts a focal asymmetry with no associated mass, calcifications
or architectural distortion, if there is no sonographic or palpable correlate to the mammo-
graphic finding, and if there are no prior mammography examinations available for compari-
son, it may be appropriate to render a probably benign (BI-RADS® category 3) assessment.
? If diagnostic mammography indicates the presence of a suspicious abnormality despite ab-
sence of a sonographic correlate (or vice versa), the appropriate overall assessment is suspi-
cious (BI-RADS® category 4).
```
```
Second, BI-RADS® category 0 should not be used for diagnostic breast imaging findings that
warrant further evaluation with MRI. Rather, the radiologist should issue a final assessment for
the combined diagnostic mammography and ultrasound examinations in a report that is made
before the MRI is performed. If further evaluation with MRI is warranted, the radiologist should
incorporate this recommendation into the patient management recommendations in the com-
bined mammography/ultrasound report. This provides the following advantages:
```
```
? If the recommended MRI examination is not performed, the combined diagnostic breast im-
aging report will stand as issued.
```
```
? If MRI is performed as recommended, it would not be necessary to re-interpret the mammog-
raphy and ultrasound examinations. A negative or benign MRI assessment would sustain a
similar assessment made at diagnostic mammography and ultrasound. If the MRI examina-
tion shows more abnormal findings than those identified at mammography and ultrasound,
the MRI assessment would supersede that made for mammography and ultrasound.
```
```
Also note that breast MRI is not appropriate follow-up in many situations, including:
```
```
? Instead of biopsy of a suspicious finding at mammography and/or ultrasound.
```
```
? As an alternative to short-interval follow-up of probably benign findings at mammography
and/or ultrasound.
```
```
? To further evaluate findings that should be recognized as benign at mammography and/or
ultrasound, such as gynecomastia or multiple bilateral mostly circumscribed masses. Also

most lymph nodes and fat necrosis may be characterized as benign at mammography and/
or ultrasound.
```
MRI is rarely helpful in further evaluation of possible architectural distortion that is too vague to
target for stereotactic or sonographic biopsy.

**9. Axillary adenopathy is seen at screening mammography with no suspicious findings in the**
    **breasts. What should the BI-RADS® final assessment be?**

In the absence of a known infectious or inflammatory cause, isolated **unilateral** axillary adenopa-
thy should receive a suspicious (BI-RADS® category 4) assessment. Unilateral axillary adenopathy
suggests occult breast carcinoma or, much less commonly, lymphoma, metastatic melanoma,
ovarian cancer, or other metastatic cancer. Consequently, a careful search of the ipsilateral breast
images is warranted. Bilateral axillary ultrasound should be performed to confirm that the finding
is asymmetric/unilateral. Clinical evaluation for infection or inflammation in the ipsilateral breast,
axilla, arm and hand is recommended at the time of ultrasound, as mastitis, breast abscess, an
infected skin lesion and cat-scratch fever are all potential sources of benign unilateral axillary
adenopathy. If a benign cause is elucidated, a benign (BI-RADS® category 2) assessment would be
appropriate. In the absence of a known infectious or inflammatory source, a suspicious (BI-RADS®
category 4) assessment would be appropriate, with intent to biopsy after further evaluation and
review of clinical history. It is then appropriate to proceed with ultrasound-guided fine-needle
aspiration (FNA) or core biopsy, and it may be advisable to perform ipsilateral whole-breast ultra-
sound at that visit to search for an occult primary breast carcinoma.

**Bilateral** axillary adenopathy would be assessed as benign (BI-RADS® category 2) in some situa-
tions, and as suspicious (BI-RADS® category 4) in others. Bilateral axillary adenopathy is frequently
reactive/infectious in origin, such as with inflammatory conditions (sarcoidosis, systemic lupus
erythematosis, psoriasis, etc) and HIV. In such situations, the appropriate assessment is benign (BI-
RADS® category 2). Patients with known lymphoma or leukemia may also have bilateral axillary
adenopathy. In this situation, the BI-RADS® assessment should be based on findings in the breasts
themselves, but the report also should indicate the presence of adenopathy and the known un-
derlying disease. For example, a report might indicate a negative or benign assessment, followed
by “with bilateral axillary adenopathy presumed due to known lymphoma”. It may be helpful to
contact the referring health care provider to clarify whether or not there is such a history before
issuing a final report. If there is no known explanation for bilateral adenopathy, and particularly if
it is new, then it may be a sign of lymphoma/leukemia and a suspicious (BI-RADS® category 4)
assessment is warranted, with recommendation for ultrasound-guided FNA or core biopsy. Note
that ideally, biopsy specimens should be kept in saline or RPMI 1640 if lymphoma is suspected,
to facilitate fluorescence-activated cell sorting.

**10. Are there BI-RADS® assessment categories and management recommendations available**
    **for breast PET scans and dedicated breast gamma camera imaging examinations? Are there**
    **plans to include these in the BI-RADS® Atlas in the future?**

Because these breast imaging modalities are so new, the BI-RADS® Atlas does not have assessment
categories and management recommendations for breast PET scans and dedicated breast gamma
camera imaging examinations at this time. The BI-RADS® Atlas will be updated with new modalities
as they become more established and widely available. In the interim, the same assessment catego-
ries for mammography, ultrasound and MRI may be used for these and other new-modality examina-
tions, so long as recommendations for patient management are clearly stated in the imaging report.

**Mammographic Views**

A suspicious lesion must always be triangulated so that its three-dimensional location within the breast
is known. This requires it to be visible on two different mammographic projections. Triangulation is
more precise if the lesion is visible on orthogonal views. The updated terminology and abbreviations for
mammographic views are displayed in Table 9 on the next page.

ACR BI-RADS® — Mammography Lexicon Classification Form
For each of the following categories, select the term that best describes the dominant lesion feature.
```
**BREAST TISSUE
Breast Composition** (select one)

? a. The breasts are almost entirely fatty

? b. There are scattered areas of fibroglandular density

? c. The breasts are homogeneously dense, which may obscure detection of small masses

? d. The breasts are extremely dense, which lowers the sensitivity of mammography

```
FINDINGS
A. Masses: A mass occupies space and should be seen in two different mammographic projections. It has a completely
or partially convex-outward contour and (if radiodense) is denser in the center than at the periphery.
? 1. Shape (select one) ? a. Oval Elliptical or egg-shaped (may include 2 or 3 undulations)
? b. Round Spherical, ball-shaped, circular, or globular
? c. Irregular Neither round nor oval in shape
? 2. Margin (select one) ? a. Circumscribed A margin that is well defined or sharp, with an abrupt
transition between the lesion and surrounding tissue
? b. Obscured A margin that is hidden by superimposed or adjacent
fibroglandular tissue
? c. Microlobulated A margin characterized by short-cycle undulations
? d. Indistinct No clear demarcation of the entire margin or any portion
of it from the surrounding tissue
? e. Spiculated Margin is formed or characterized by sharp lines project-
ing from the mass
? 3. Density (select one) ? a. High density X-ray attenuation of the mass is greater than the expected
attenuation of an equal volume of fibroglandular breast
tissue
? b. Equal density X-ray attenuation of the mass is the same as the expected
attenuation of an equal volume of fibroglandular breast
tissue
? c. Low density X-ray attenuation of the mass is less than the expected
attenuation of an equal volume of fibroglandular
breast tissue
? d. Fat-containing Includes all lesions containing fat, such as oil cyst,
lipoma, or galactocele as well as mixed-density lesions
such as hamartoma
```

### FIFTH EDITION — 2013

```
? B. Calcifications (select one)
? 1. Typically benign
(select one)
```
```
? a. Skin Usually lucent-centered and pathognomonic in appear-
ance
? b. Vascular Parallel tracks or linear, tubular calcifications that are
clearly associated with blood vessels
? c. Coarse or
“popcorn-like”
```
```
These calcifications are classic, large (> 2 to 3 mm in great-
est diameter), produced by an involuting fibroadenoma
? d. Large rod-like Associated with ductal ectasia, may form solid or discon-
tinuous, smooth linear rods, usually
? 0.5 mm in diameter
? e. Round May vary in size and, therefore, also in opacity (when
smaller than 0.5 mm, the term “punctate” should be used)
? f. Rim Appear as calcium deposited on the surface of a sphere
(usually less than 1 mm in thickness when viewed on
edge)
? g. Dystrophic Irregular in shape and usually larger than 1 mm in size;
often with lucent centers
? h. Milk of calcium A manifestation of sedimented calcifications in macro-
or microcysts, usually but not always grouped – on the
craniocaudal image – often less evident and appear as
round, smudgy deposits, while occasionally on MLO and
especially on 90° lateral (LM/ML) views – more clearly
defined and often semilunar, crescent shaped, curvilinear
(concave up) or linear, defining the dependent portion of
cysts. The most important feature of these calcifications
is the apparent change in shape of the calcific particles
on different mammographic projections (craniocaudal
versus occasionally the MLO view and especially LM/ML
views)
? i. Suture Typically linear or tubular in appearance; when present,
knots are frequently visible
? 2. Suspicious
morphology
(select one)
```
```
? a. Amorphous Sufficiently small and/or hazy in appearance that a more
specific particle shape cannot be determined
? b. Coarse heterogeneous Irregular, conspicuous calcifications that are generally
between 0.5 mm and 1 mm and tend to coalesce but are
smaller than dystrophic calcifications
? c. Fine pleomorphic Usually more conspicuous than amorphous forms and
are seen to have discrete shapes - these irregular calcifi-
cations are distinguished from fine linear and fine-linear
branching forms by the absence of fine-linear particles
```
- they vary in size and shape and are usually smaller than
0.5 mm in diameter
? d. Fine linear or fine-
linear branching

```
Thin, linear, irregular calcifications, which may be discon-
tinuous and which are smaller than 0.5 mm in caliber –
occasionally, branching forms may be seen
```

### BI-RADS® ATLAS — MAMMOGRAPHY

```
? 3. Distribution
(select one)
```
? a. Diffuse Distributed randomly throughout the breast
? b. Regional Used for numerous calcifications that occupy a large por-
tion of breast tissue (more than 2 cm in greatest dimen-
sion), not conforming to a duct distribution - may involve
most of a quadrant or even more than a single quadrant
? c. Grouped Used when relatively few calcifications occupy a small
portion of breast tissue - lower limit for use of this
descriptor is 5 calcifications grouped within 1 cm of each
other or when a definable pattern is identified – upper
limit for use of this descriptor is for larger numbers of
calcifications grouped within 2 cm of each other
? d. Linear Calcifications arrayed in a line
? e. Segmental Used when the distribution of calcifications suggests
deposits in a duct or ducts and their branches
? **C. Architectural distortion:** The parenchyma is distorted with no definite mass visible.

? **D. Asymmetries:** Involve a spectrum of mammographic findings that represent unilateral deposits of fibroglandu-
lar tissue not conforming to the definition of a radiodense mass, that is, having concave-outward contour and often
interspersed with fat. (select one)
? 1. Asymmetry An area of fibroglandular-density tissue that is visible
on only one mammographic projection, frequently
representing superimposition of normal breast structures
(summation artifact)
? 2. Global
asymmetry

```
Judged relative to the corresponding area in the
contralateral breast and represents a large amount of
fibroglandular-density tissue over a substantial por-
tion of the breast (at least one quadrant) – there is no
mass, distorted architecture, or associated suspicious
calcifications
? 3. Focal
asymmetry
```
```
Judged relative to the corresponding location in the
contralateral breast and represents a relatively small
amount of fibroglandular-density tissue over a confined
portion of the breast (less than one quadrant) – having
similar shape on different mammographic projections,
with convex-outward borders
? 4. Developing
asymmetry
```
```
A focal asymmetry that is new, larger, or more conspicu-
ous than on a previous examination
```
? **E. Intramammary lymph nodes:** These are circumscribed masses that are reniform and have hilar fat. They are gen-
erally 1 cm or smaller in size. (They may be larger than 1 cm and characterized as normal when fat replacement is
pronounced – and frequently occur in the upper portions of the breast closer to the axilla, although they may occur
anywhere in the breast.)
? **F. Skin lesion:** This finding may be described in the mammography report or annotated on the mammographic image
when it projects over the breast (especially on two different projections) and may be mistaken for an intramammary
lesion.

? **G. Solitary dilated duct:** This is a unilateral tubular or branching structure that likely represents a dilated or otherwise
enlarged duct.

? **H. Associated features:** Used with masses, asymmetries, or calcifications, or may stand alone as FINDINGS when no other
abnormality is present. (select all that apply)
? 1. Skin retraction The skin is pulled in abnormally


### FIFTH EDITION — 2013

```
? 2. Nipple
retraction
```
```
The nipple is pulled in (should not be confused with
nipple inversion, which is often bilateral)
? 3. Skin thickening May be focal or diffuse, and is defined as being greater
than 2 mm in thickness
? 4. Trabecular
thickening
```
```
A thickening of the fibrous septa of the breast
```
```
? 5. Axillary
adenopathy
```
```
Enlarged axillary lymph nodes may warrant comment,
clinical correlation and additional evaluation, especially
if new or considerably larger or rounder when compared
to previous examination
? 6. Architectural
distortion
```
```
As an ASSOCIATED FEATURE, architectural distortion
may be used in conjunction with another finding to
indicate that the parenchyma is distorted or retracted
adjacent to the finding
? 7. Calcifications As an ASSOCIATED FEATURE, this may be used in con-
junction with one or more other finding(s) to describe
calcifications within or immediately adjacent to the
finding(s) (see descriptors of calcifications, section B)
? I. Location of lesion — A suspicious lesion must always be triangulated so that its three-dimensional location within the
breast is known. This requires it to be visible on two different mammographic projections. Triangulation is more precise
if the lesion is visible on orthogonal views.
```
1. Laterality Right or left breast
2. Quadrant and clock-
    face

```
Use of both clock-face and quadrant location is encour-
aged
```
3. Depth Indicate depth in the breast (anterior, middle, posterior
    third)
4. Distance from the
    nipple

```
Distance of the lesion from the nipple provides a more
precise indication of its depth
