ltrasound (US) characterization of mammographic and palpable abnormalities is indicated in
the evaluation and management of breast disease. However, standardization of an effective, reli-
able technique for whole breast examination is a work in progress. In Europe and Asia, for many
years, breast screening with ultrasound has been physician performed. In the U.S., practice patterns are
in flux, with the majority of breast sonograms performed by sonographers, usually directed to a par-
ticular area identified on other imaging modalities or by physical examination. Because we anticipate
that US screening as a supplement to mammography will become more widely practiced in the U.S., we
offer guidance for training and performance as was provided in ACRIN 6666. [3,4,5]
The effective use of an US lexicon is predicated on excellent sonographic technique and an understand-
ing of breast anatomy. The descriptors comprising a lexicon for breast US are defined and exemplified in
the sections that follow. Crucial to accurate assessment of masses is a method of lesion characterization
achieved through analysis of multiple features rather than any single one. Some features are unique to
US, such as orientation and echogenicity, and some are fundamental to interpreting breast lesions with
any imaging technique, such as shape and margin.
The Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS®) for mammography has improved the assess-
ment of masses, calcifications, and other mammographic findings, and the BI-RADS® final assessment
phrases have been incorporated into the Mammography Quality Standards Act of 1992 (MQSA). The
integration of US and mammographic findings promotes their clinical practicality.
The American College of Radiology (ACR) recognized the need for an ultrasound lexicon in the late
1990’s. Upon receipt of a grant from the Office on Women’s Health of the Department of Health and
Human Services in 1998, to support protocol development for research in breast US [Contract 282-
97-0076, Federal Technology Transfer Program to Advance Novel Breast Imaging Technologies, U.S. Public
Health Service Office on Women’s Health, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services], the College
convened an expert working group with national and international representation. Research topics
for protocol development included breast cancer screening with US, differentiation of benign from
malignant solid masses and the possible therapeutic applications of US. The need for consistent and
standardized terminology became acute, particularly in designing studies of solid mass characteris-
tics and of screening, where criteria for probably benign masses required strict definition. Using tech-
niques similar to those used for BI-RADS® mammography, agreement on terminology and assessment
categorization was reached by consensus of this expert working group and its subcommittee.
Several feature descriptors are frequently used in analyzing mammographic findings, with the most worri-
some feature the dominant consideration in selecting a final assessment category and management rec-
ommendation. Similarly, when mammography and US reports are combined, the most abnormal features
should usually determine the assessment of the lesion.
Wherever possible and appropriate, the established descriptive terms in the lexicon for mammogra-
phy were utilized for ultrasound interpretation. In the important feature categories of shape and mar-
gin, many of the descriptors work equally well for both. Since the publication of BI-RADS® ultrasound
in 2003, there have been advances in ultrasound, such as elastography, included here among the As-
sociated Features. Image quality, anatomy, the male breast, and a guidance chapter, with Frequently
Asked Questions have also been added. This document will continue to change as breast ultrasound
continues to evolve, with its roles for diagnostic and screening indications being further elucidated

among those of other breast imaging modalities such as mammography (including tomosynthesis),
MRI, and molecular imaging. [1,6]

This illustrated Fifth Edition of the BI-RADS® Atlas is designed for everyday practice and should make it pos-
sible to issue meaningful and unambiguous breast imaging reports. BI-RADS® was always intended to be a
dynamic and evolving document that would adapt to changes in the practice of breast imaging and be of
practical use to interpreting physicians. Therefore, the BI-RADS® Committee welcomes any comments and/
or suggestions from its users and requests that these be submitted in writing or electronically to the ACR.
However, prior to submitting comments or suggestions, please first visit the ACR BI-RADS® website at ht tp: //
acr.org/~/media/ACR/Documents/PDF/QualitySaftely/Resources/BIRADS/BIRADSFAQs.pdf, which displays
Committee-approved responses to suggestions already submitted.

he ACR Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS®) is a quality assurance tool designed
to standardize reporting, reduce confusion in breast imaging interpretations and management
recommendations, and facilitate outcomes monitoring. All interpreting physicians and referring
health care providers should be aware of the benefits and limitations of breast imaging technologies.
```
```
The terminology used to describe breast ultrasound findings is still evolving, and the diversity of this
terminology may cause confusion. The descriptive terms and definitions contained in the lexicon have
been approved by the ACR Subcommittee on BI-RADS® Ultrasound. Employing these terms exclusively
will help ensure that reports are clear, concise and standardized. The subcommittee believes that these
terms provide a reasonably complete evidence-based categorization of lesions depicted at ultrasound;
however, as the field is still evolving, new terminology may be needed or existing terminology modi-
fied. If you would like to propose a substantive change, please submit it to the ACR for review by the
BI-RADS® Committee, using the contact information mentioned in the Preface.
```
```
The ACR Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System - Ultrasound is divided into four sections with an
appendix at the end.
```
```
SECTION I: General Considerations
```
```
SECTION II: Breast Imaging Lexicon - Ultrasound
```
```
SECTION III: Reporting System
```
```
SECTION IV: Guidance
```
```
Appendix
```
```
The following are brief summaries of each section.
```
```
I. General Considerations
```
```
This section discusses the anatomy of the breast, image quality issues and techniques, labeling
and measurement of the images, and documenting results of the examination.
II. Breast Imaging Lexicon — Ultrasound
Breast Ultrasound is very useful for breast imaging. The lexicon offers a set of standardized terms
along with copious examples of how and when these terms should be used. It is the belief of
the Subcommittee on BI-RADS® Ultrasound that widespread use of these descriptors will enable
radiologists everywhere to communicate results clearly and efficiently to other physicians and
their patients.
III. Reporting System
Just as in mammography, utilizing the reporting system will provide an organized approach to
image interpretation and reporting. Using a computer-based reporting software application is
not required, but is strongly recommended. This will facilitate clear, concise, and standardized re-
porting, and further enable simultaneous data collection for the maintenance of a database for

```
future outcomes review (audit). Regular audits enable individual interpreting physicians and breast
imaging facilities to monitor their own results and appraise the accuracy of image interpretation so
that they can adjust interpretive thresholds appropriately. We strongly recommended using soft-
ware which requires minimal data entry. The interpreting physician’s attention should be focused
on the evaluation of images not data input. The simplest input will utilize a single screen for normal
examinations and require limited interaction for abnormal examinations. If practical, we recom-
mend use of a scribe to enter data.
Report Organization
Using the recommended terminology is the key to consistently producing understandable breast
imaging reports. The BI-RADS® approach to reporting breast imaging examinations categorizes
the overall composition of the breast and then describes noncalcified lesions by their shape,
orientation, margin, echo patterns, and posterior acoustic features. Calcifications are described
according to size and distribution. The findings are then evaluated and an assessment rendered
that includes the degree of suspicion for malignancy. Finally, the report indicates the pertinent
management recommendation(s). Thus, the breast ultrasound report should be divided into:
```
**1. INDICATION FOR EXAMINATION
2. STATEMENT OF SCOPE AND TECHNIQUE OF BREAST US EXAMINATION
3. SUCCINCT DESCRIPTION OF THE OVERALL BREAST COMPOSITION
4. CLEAR DESCRIPTION OF ANY IMPORTANT FINDINGS
5. COMPARISON TO PREVIOUS EXAMINATION(S), INCLUDING CORRELATION WITH PHYSI-**
    **CAL, MAMMOGRAPHY, OR MRI FINDINGS
6. COMPOSITE REPORTS
7. ASSESSMENT
8. MANAGEMENT**
Note that breast ultrasound examinations are sometimes reported separately from mam-
    mography and sometimes reported as part of a combined examination. In either case, the
    structure of the report should follow some general guidelines to make it clear and concise.
**IV. Guidance**
Through the years of continued BI-RADS® usage, the committee has received many questions
and reports of problems related to the various sections that comprise BI-RADS®. To address these
concerns, to introduce changes in terminology and assessments, and to explain the reasons for
these changes, we offer a guidance chapter.
**Appendix**
The appendix contains a form for easily noting the findings of an ultrasound examination with
the appropriate BI-RADS® terminology in a simple checklist. This form also contains the BI-RADS®
assessment categories.

layer whose total thickness is 2mm or less, except in the periareolar region or inframammary
fold. A gel offset enables the upper layer of skin to be seen. Make certain that the focal zone is
set superficially. In the fibroglandular layer (FG) beneath the normal 2 mm skin complex and
superficial fat lobules (F) is an 8 mm microlobulated invasive ductal carcinoma. (Image courtesy

```
```
As few as seven or eight and as many as 20 lobes, loosely associated duct segments, are the ana-
tomic components of the breast. Each segment starts in the fine peripheral branches and ends
in a large collecting duct, its punctum visible on the nipple. The most peripheral ducts, the intra-
lobular terminal ducts, end in the terminal duct-lobular units that give rise to common malignant
and benign pathology.
```
```
The subclavian and axillary arteries and their lateral thoracic, thoracoacromial and internal mam-
mary branches provide arterial supply to the breast. The venous plexus lies just beneath the nip-
ple. Over 90% of the lymphatics of the breast drain into the ipsilateral axilla, with a small percent-
age of drainage into the internal mammary chain. In women who have had axillary dissections or
mastectomies extending into the axilla, lymphatic drainage may cross to the contralateral axilla.
```
**A. BREAST ANATOMY**

```
The breast is located on the chest wall between the second and the sixth ribs within layers of the
superficial pectoral fascia. The fat and fibroglandular tissue of the breast reside between the super-
ficial layer of this fascia just beneath the skin, a 2 mm echogenic complex with hypoechoic layer
sandwiched between, and the deep layer which lies just anterior to the pectoral muscle (Figure 1).

**1. AXILLA**
    The axilla contains lymph nodes, the brachial plexus, and axillary artery and vein. The number and
    size of normal axillary lymph nodes varies widely from individual to individual. Side-to-side sym-
    metry of size, shape, and number of nodes may help distinguish normal from abnormal. Nodes
    may be depicted in the axillae on mammograms, commonly two, three, or more can be identified
    as circumscribed oval (often reniform) masses with hilar fat and cortices of fibroglandular tissue
    density. With US, normal lymph nodes, axillary or intramammary, have echogenic hilar areas and
    cortices that are hypoechoic to anechoic.

**2. NIPPLE AND AREOLA**

```
The nipple-areolar complex is quite variable, with areolar width narrow in some women or ex-
tending for a centimeter or two in others, making the nipple a more reliable landmark than the
areola. Normal nipples can be prominent, flat, or inverted.
If an abnormality is suspected, or for interpretive confidence, look at the contralateral breast as
you would for any other paired organ. The nipple’s crevices and irregular surface cause posterior
acoustic attenuation, and an offset pad or thick layer of gel can provide a medium for clear depic-
tion (Figs. 4a, 4b and 4c). The skin of the areola tapers as the areola extends to either side of the
nipple. The width of normal skin over the breast is 0.2 cm except for the region of the inframam-
mary fold and the areola, where the skin is normally a little thicker.
```
```
Figure 4 — ANATOMY: NIPPLE AND UNDERLYING BREAST
TISSUE. Size and appearance of the nipple are variable, from
retracted to flat to protuberant. A gel offset (a and b) enables
the skin and superficial tissue to be seen. The nipple in (a) is
normal. If there is concern for abnormality, as with any other
paired organ, comparison with the normal side is helpful
in decision making. (b) Nipple is enlarged due to mucinous
carcinoma contained within it. (c) Automated supine whole
breast scan. Upper image is B-mode acquisition (X-plane

**3. GYNECOMASTIA**

```
Hormonal effects of certain medications including antihypertensives, antidepressants, H2 blockers,
illicit drugs, and endocrine active tumors stimulate development of rudimentary breast tissue. Ducts
and stroma located in the retroareolar region, typically “flame-shaped” on mammograms extending
posterolaterally from the nipple, are often asymmetric.
```

**B. IMAGE QUALITY**

**1. TRANSDUCER FREQUENCY**
    As with all imaging modalities, ultrasound’s value for detection and diagnosis largely de-
       pends on the quality of the images. Handheld, high-frequency breast ultrasound can be par-
       ticularly prone to operator dependence if a system’s many image parameters are not optimally
       modulated. Poor ultrasound image quality can lead to serious misinterpretations such as mistak-
       ing a cancer for a cyst. The ACR Practice Guideline for the Performance of a Breast Ultrasound
       Examination (2011) [1] recommends use of a broad bandwidth linear array transducer with
       a center frequency of at least 10 MHz. At the high frequency end (between 12 and 18 MHz),
       these transducers provide high resolution images. In their lower frequency ranges, tissue
       penetration of 5 cm is obtainable.
    Higher frequency sound waves are more strongly attenuated by breast tissue than lower fre-
       quency waves. With proper positioning, most breasts in the supine or supine-oblique position
       are only a few centimeters thick, and high frequencies can provide optimal image quality for
       all of the breast tissue. However, when evaluating deep tissue in patients with particularly large
       breasts, it may be helpful to select lower frequency settings on multifrequency transducers, to
       use a lower frequency transducer, if available, or to apply greater compression for improvement
       of sound penetration and reduction of attenuation.
   .

```

distortion of this irregularly shaped carcinoma (longitudinal view) operating at 7.2 MHz is less
well characterized (a) than same mass (b) imaged at 14 MHz, with which cicatrization of the
Cooper’s ligaments is more conspicuous and angular and the indistinct margin of the mass more
confidently characterizable due to improved resolution of the higher frequency transducer.

Figure 7 — IMAGE QUALITY: DOPPLER SETTINGS. B-mode and color flow images with too much
compression in (a) causing vessels to be occluded. Doppler frequency 6.3 MHz is correct; pulse
repetition frequency (PRF) of 2.5 kHz would be correct for rapid flow states but is inappropriate for
the slower flow in this breast mass. Image (b) has the same incorrect settings as in (a), but scanning
without compression allows depiction of some vascularity within lesion. In (c), with the same Doppler
frequency and scanning without compression but with correct PRF of 500 Hz (0.5 kHz) there is more
accurate depiction of slow flow vascular characteristics of the mass. Histopathology: invasive and
intraductal carcinoma. (Image courtesy of Giorgio Rizzatto, MD)
```
```
Figure 8 — IMAGE QUALITY: TRANSDUCER FREQUENCY. The image obtained with a linear transducer
whose frequency range is 12 – 5MHz is diagnostic (a) but greatly improved with a transducer whose
frequency range is 17 – 5 MHz (b). In both images, the microcalcifications present within ducts
(arrows) in the echogenic fibroglandular zone of tissue can be seen, but resolution of these particles
and the ductal anatomy is better with the higher frequency probe. (Images courtesy of Marcela
Böhm-Vélez, MD)

Figure 9 — IMAGE QUALITY: TRANSDUCER FREQUENCY, RESOLUTION AND CONTRAST SETTINGS.
Confident interpretation of margin and shape of the mass is not possible in (a) because of outdated
technology: low transducer frequency, high contrast settings with a poor gray scale. The same mass
in the image on the right (b) appears to be better focused, and the higher resolution allows the
characteristics of a simple cyst to be depicted. The BI-RADS® assessment based on image (b) would
be benign (category 2), while in image (a) it might be suspicious (category 4). Annotation overlies
the skin in image (a); no text should overlie an image unless the image is captured with and without
annotation, as is suggested for lesion measurement. Note that image (b) is labeled for cyst aspiration,
which would not have been necessary unless the patient was symptomatic (therapeutic aspiration).
Image quality for (a) would be unacceptable at this time. (Images courtesy of Jay Baker, M.D)
```
```
Figure 10 — IMAGE QUALITY: EFFECTS OF HIGHER FREQUENCY AND COMPRESSION. (a) Oval mass in
sagittal view has indistinct margins at 7.2 MHz (linear transducer, frequency range 14 – 7 MHz). Diagnosis
of simple cyst cannot be made, and the patient would most likely have undergone aspiration. Same
mass (b) imaged with same transducer but operating at 14 MHz is identifiable as a simple cyst. Additional
compression of the tissue with the probe helps to reduce refraction shadowing that is prominent in
image (a). Improved image quality in image (b) allowed BI-RADS® assessment as benign (category 2).

**2. FIELD OF VIEW**

The field of view (FOV) refers to the depth setting of tissue that will be displayed on the monitor.
When searching for lesions, the field should be deep enough to include breast tissue and the pec-
toralis muscle posterior to it. The FOV should not include the pleura or lung.

```
Figure 11 — IMAGE QUALITY: FOV. Single view of the left breast at 6:00 o’clock with breast tissue
occupying only 50% of the FOV. From a depth of 2 cm to 4 cm, there is no information related to
the breast. The focal range is also set too deeply. (Image courtesy of Ellen B. Mendelson, MD)
```
```
When a lesion is found, temptation is to reset the field to a shallower depth or to zoom exces-
sively. In both of these instances, the margin of the mass may be misinterpreted as indistinct.
When the FOV is set too deep, small lesions appear minified and cannot be characterized
confidently.
```
```
Figure 12 — IMAGE QUALITY: FOV. The lower portion of this trapezoidal image contains no information.
Small, 0.4 x 0.3 cm, mass located 0.8 cm deep from the skin is poorly visualized in this sonogram set to a
depth of 5.5 cm. Image appears minified. (Image courtesy of Jay Baker, MD)
```

### FIFTH EDITION — 2013

```
For larger lesions, there are several methods that can be used to show the entire lesion in
one image. Available with some transducers is extended field-of-view imaging, also called
panoramic, which may help to demonstrate the relationship of these lesions to surrounding
tissue. Extended field of view can also be useful to demonstrate the geographic relationship
among multiple lesions or between a lesion and a structure such as the nipple. As with wide
field-of-view automated ultrasound, freehand extended field of view is also useful for imag-
ing multiple masses as well as large lesions.

### BI-RADS® ATLAS — BREAST ULTRASOUND

```
Some systems with dual screens enable image halves to be spliced. Approximately half of a
large lesion or regional area of interest is captured, the image frozen; then the second image
screen is activated and the other half captured. The edges of large lesions are approximated
on a screen that shows both halves, and the entirety or most of the mass then is measured, al-
beit not precisely. Matching the anatomic landmarks provided by ducts, fat lobules, and depth
from the skin facilitate accuracy. Wide FOV sweeps (panoramic display) are more accurate and
should be used whenever possible (Figure 16).
```
```
There are additional methods as well: images produced by some linear transducers can be wid-
ened at the base of the image which then appears trapezoidal as opposed to rectangular.
```
```
Figure 16 — IMAGE QUALITY: EXTENDED FOV shows infiltration of invasive lobular carcinoma throughout the
fibroglandular tissue (a). Extended FOV imaging is useful for imaging large breast masses, for demonstrating
distances between lesions, and for showing the relationship of lesions to other structures. Spliced image (b) of a
4 x 7 cm fibroadenoma is another method of US depiction of large abnormalities. This method is a workaround
that approximates the size of the mass and shows less of the tissue surrounding it. (Image 16a courtesy of Jay

**3. FOCAL ZONE**
    Variable focusing is available in many transducers. The focal zone(s) should be placed in the
    anterior-to-middle third of the region of interest between the skin and chest wall. When eval-
    uating a lesion, the focal zone is optimally placed in the center of the lesion. Two to three
    focal zones or a single focal zone that has variable range will increase the resolution of the
    tissue imaged within that zone. However, in many systems, if more than three focal zones are
    used, the frame rate will be slowed significantly, losing the benefits of real-time scanning.
    Many systems have transducers that can be used with broad focal zone ranges that facilitate
    rapidity of scanning large areas of the breast. If targeted scans are being done, a single zone
    or narrow range can be set at the midlevel of the mass or area of interest. Artifacts and blur
    caused by poor placement of the focal zones can cause misinterpretation of breast lesions.

```
Figure 22 — IMAGE QUALITY: EFFECT OF FOCAL ZONE SETTINGS: (a) Focal zone inappropriately
positioned below the mass causing echoes to appear within its anterior half; (b) with focal zone
set properly in the midportion of the mass, its anechogenicity is unquestioned. The echoes seen
in (a) are confirmed as artifactual. The FOV in both images is too deeply set. (Images courtesy of

are set at the depth of the lesion (a). When the focal zones are set
at the posterior aspect of the lesion (c) or adjacent to the pectoral
muscle (b), while the shadowing remains intense, there is some
improvement of visualization of anatomy posterior to the cancer.

**4. GRAY SCALE GAIN**
    Ultrasound waves are absorbed by tissue; the deeper the tissue, the greater the absorption, with
    less of the beam available to create an image. Increasing the gain may help compensate for this
    by increasing the brightness of the image, but penetration of tissue for adequate depiction also
    depends on transducer frequency (greater penetration inversely proportional to frequency), focal
    zone settings, power increase, and appropriate selection of field of view. GRAY SCALE gain should
    be set so normal breast parenchyma varies in echogenicity using much of the gray scale range.
    The gain may be set too high if the tissue appears as varying shades of white, which can obscure
    some lesions and make some cysts appear solid. The gain may be set too low if the parenchyma
    appears dark gray to black, causing some very hypoechoic solid lesions to appear anechoic and be
    mistaken for simple cysts. As a reference setting for the gray scale, subcutaneous fat lobules should
    appear medium gray, never black.

```
Figure 24 — IMAGE QUALITY: GRAY SCALE GAIN. Mass imaged with appropriate gain settings allows
criteria for simple cyst to be applied. The center of the cyst appears anechoic and surrounding fat and
parenchyma are distinguished by the different shades of gray in this well-modulated image. A small
complicated cyst is seen at the right margin of and anterior to the larger simple cyst. (Image courtesy
of Marcela Böhm-Vélez, MD)
```

### BI-RADS® ATLAS — BREAST ULTRASOUND

**5. COMPOUND IMAGING**

```
Real-time spatial compound imaging creates a single ultrasound frame by averaging several
overlapping ultrasound images obtained at slightly different angles of insonation. The different
angles are obtained by electronically steering the transducer array. The process can be repeated
so rapidly that imaging occurs in real time, but the frame rate will slow as an increasing number
of overlapping images is selected. Compound imaging reduces noise (speckle) and improves
resolution in the center of the image. Architectural alterations may be easier to appreciate with
compound imaging.
```
```
When masses are centered in an image obtained with spatial compounding, the margins are
more confidently interpreted. The posterior features, shadowing and enhancement, may be
less apparent but still discernible with spatial compounding, and enhancement may appear
conical reflecting the pattern of intersecting beam angles.
```
```
Figure 25 — IMAGE QUALITY: SPATIAL COMPOUNDING. Ultrasound image in native mode
(a) demonstrates reverberation artifact in anterior, nondependent wall of cyst (arrow). Spatial
compounding technique (b) eliminates artifacts, making the cyst appear anechoic. In both of these
images, the focal zone is set correctly. (Image courtesy of Marcela Böhm-Vélez, MD)

not as sharp as it is in (a), obtained with spatial compounding. In (b) also, the lateral refraction shadows
are nearly imperceptible, and the tissue lateral to the cyst is depicted clearly. Posterior enhancement
is unmistakeable, while not as bright as that in (a) and of a more conical shape, narrow in the deepest
portion of the image frame. (Images courtesy of Ellen B. Mendelson, MD)

**C. Labeling and Measurement**

Breast ultrasound images should include the following labeling as described in the ACR Practice
Guidelines for the Performance of Breast Ultrasound Examination and the ACR Practice Guide-
lines for the Performance of Ultrasound-Guided Percutaneous Breast Interventional Procedures
[1,2].

1. Facility name and location
2. Examination date
3. Patient’s first and last name
4. Identifying number and/or date of birth
5. Designation of right or left breast
6. Anatomic location using clock-face notation (to the nearest half hour) or a labeled diagram of
    the breast
7. Transducer orientation (e.g., radial, antiradial, oblique, or transverse and sagittal)
8. Distance from the nipple to the abnormality or the area being scanned in centimeters (measure
    from the nipple as a standard reference point, not the edge of the very variable areola)
9. Sonographer’s and/or physician’s identification number, initials, or other symbol

```
How To Measure
The sonologist or sonographer should seek the longest axis of a lesion, similar
to what would be done for measuring a kidney or an ovary, and then obtain an
orthogonal image with a measurement in the plane not present on the initial
image. A common error is to use the rectangular frame of an image as the refer-
ence standard for measuring lesions (see Figure 27). Often, a mass is not oriented
horizontally or vertically but obliquely within the image. For solid or complex
cystic and solid lesions, an image with color or power Doppler is also desirable.
Although real-time scanning is optimal, video clips of the study may also con-
tribute some interpretive confidence when the interpreter of the exam is not the
performer, but video clips should not be a substitute for direct interpreter scanning if
questions persist.
```

### BI-RADS® ATLAS — BREAST ULTRASOUND

**Measurements**

1. Record measurements to the nearest **millimeter** or **centimeter**. For example, 0.45 cm–0.49 cm
    should be rounded up to 0.5 cm and 0.11–0.14 cm should be rounded down to 0.1 cm.
2. When possible, three measurements of a lesion should be given. The largest measurement
    should represent the longest axis of a lesion if there is one. The next measurement should be the
    one perpendicular to the first. The third measurement should be taken from a view orthogonal
    to the first image, and it should represent a plane different from the first two. For example, see
    diagram below.

```
A. Initial image of lesion B. Orthogonal view (turned 90 degrees)
 Superior to Inferior  Lateral to Medial
 Anterior to Posterior
If 2-D ultrasound is performed with two perpendicular images allowing three measure-
ments to be made or if using a 3-D transducer, and if it is necessary, the volume of a mass
can be computed and reported. If posterior acoustic shadowing is intense, the posterior
margin of the mass may be obscured and the anterior-posterior dimension may not be
measurable.
```
```

should be measured as in (a), first finding the longest axis of the mass and then a measurement

should not be the reference for measuring. (Image courtesy of Ellen B. Mendelson, MD)

### FIFTH EDITION — 2013

**D. DOCUMENTATION**

```
Cysts, Intramammary Lymph Nodes, and Multiple Benign Masses
When there are multiple cysts, representative images suffice. Each and every cyst does not need
to be documented in two views, and where there are several cysts, measurement of the largest in
each breast along only its longest axis will be sufficient. If the US examination is directed to a mam-
mographic abnormality(ies) or if the cyst corresponds to an area of clinical concern to the patient, phy-
sician, or other health care provider, its measurements should be recorded as previously discussed.
However, if a solitary asymptomatic simple cyst is identified at screening US, it should be fully evalu-
ated by the operator at real-time scanning to establish its characteristically benign features, but it does
not require complete documentation; one image along the longest axis of the cyst would be sufficient
if the cyst is described in the report (benign assessment), or no documentation at all if the cyst is not
described in the report (negative assessment).
Although cysts can occur in high axillary tail location or in accessory breast tissue within the axilla,
such a location should suggest other etiologies, such as metastatic lymph nodes. Color or power
Doppler and some elastographic methods can offer confirmation of the circumscribed, anechoic
mass as a simple cyst.
Similar guidance is pertinent for the documentation of intramammary lymph node(s). If the US
examination is directed to a mammographic abnormality(ies) or if the node corresponds to an area
of clinical concern to the patient, physician, or other health care provider, full documentation of the
lesion is appropriate. However, an asymptomatic, characteristically benign intramammary lymph
node, fully evaluated at real-time scanning or observed incidentally, does not require complete or
even any documentation.
For multiple bilateral solid masses, as in mammography, benign (category 2) is the appropriate as-
sessment, so long as all the masses are similar in appearance. If the interpreter prefers to document
all rather than the largest in each quadrant or in each breast, reporting should be in the form of a list
including clock-face locations of the masses, distance from the nipple, and three orthogonal mea-
surements. When there are numerous masses in the same area, reporting the depth from the skin
to the anterior aspect of a lesion also helps to differentiate it from others. However, the interpreter
should be aware that complete documentation of any characteristically benign finding(s) will cause
a screening US examination to be considered audit-positive.

**A. TISSUE COMPOSITION**

```
The wide normal variability in tissue composition seen on mammograms can also be observed
on US images. Just as increasing breast density diminishes the sensitivity of mammography in the
detection of small masses, heterogeneous background echotexture of the breast may affect the
sensitivity of breast sonograms for lesion detection.
```
1. HOMOGENEOUS BACKGROUND ECHOTEXTURE — FAT
    Fat lobules and uniformly echogenic bands of supporting structures (Cooper’s ligaments [ar-
    rows]) comprise the bulk of breast tissue.

```

59-year-old patient is easily characterized and compared with mammography using extended FOV or

2. HOMOGENEOUS BACKGROUND ECHOTEXTURE — FIBROGLANDULAR
A thick zone of homogeneously echogenic fibroglandular parenchyma is present beneath the
    thin hypoechoic layer of fat lobules. Many lesions, cancers and fibroadenomas, for example, are
    found within the fibroglandular zone or at its junction with the layer of fat.

```
Figure 31 — HOMOGENEOUS BACKGROUND ECHOTEXTURE — FIBROGLANDULAR. The breast at puberty
resembles gynecomastia with hypoechoic tissue immediately posterior to the nipple. Because these young
patients ordinarily do not undergo mammography, it is important not to misinterpret the hypoechoic
retroareolar breast bud as an abnormality requiring biopsy. This area should be recognized as normal for
this age group; if it is removed surgically, the breast will not develop. (Images courtesy of Helmut Madjar, MD)
```

3. HETEROGENEOUS BACKGROUND ECHOTEXTURE
Heterogeneity can be either focal or diffuse. The breast echotexture is characterized by multiple
    small areas of increased and decreased echogenicity. Shadowing may occur at the interfaces of fat
    lobules and parenchyma. This pattern occurs in younger breasts and those with heterogeneously
    dense parenchyma depicted mammographically. Whether and how this pattern affects the sensi-
    tivity of sonography merits study, but technical maneuvers may help resolve interpretive dilemmas
    that occasionally result in unnecessary biopsy.

**B. MASSES**

```
A mass is three dimensional and occupies space. With 2-D ultrasound, it should be seen in two
different planes, and in three planes with volumetric acquisitions. Masses can be distinguished
from normal anatomic structures, such as ribs or fat lobules, using two or more projections and
real-time scanning.

is circumscribed, and orientation (longest axis of mass) is parallel to the skin. Refraction shadowing is present at
the edges of curved surfaces, particularly noticeable in (b). Applying increased probe pressure or slight alteration
in patient’s position or probe angle can minimize this effect. Combined features suggest benign etiology. Patient

2. ORIENTATION

```
This feature of masses is unique to US imaging. Orientation is defined with reference to the skin
line. Obliquely situated masses may follow a radial pattern, and their long axes will help determine
classification as parallel or not parallel. Parallel or “wider-than-tall” orientation is a property of most
benign masses, notably fibroadenomas; however, many carcinomas have this orientation as well.
Orientation alone should not be used as an isolated feature in assessing a mass for its likelihood of
malignancy.
a. Parallel (historically, “wider-than-tall” or “horizontal”)
The long axis of the mass parallels the skin line. Masses that are only slightly obiquely oriented
might be considered parallel.
```

a margin that is not circumscribed and it is located just anterior to the fibrous capsule of the implant. Echogenic
flecks clumped within the mass are calcifications. Histopathology: invasive ductal carcinoma, grade 2. (Image

shape and not circumscribed (indistinct) margin on perpendicular views (a) and (b). The tumor extends
through the fibroglandular zone of breast tissue. Portions of the mass show posterior shadowing;
in other areas, there is no change in posterior features. Histopathology: invasive carcinoma (ductal
and lobular features). The white line 1 cm deep to the skin in (a) is a Cooper’s ligament, not a needle.

of the breast cone. Mass, surrounded by an echogenic rim, contains calcifications. Margin is not
circumscribed (microlobulated), and assessment in this case is suspicious (category 4). Surrounding
tissue is fatty, and posterior shadowing reflects interfaces of fat lobules and Cooper’s ligaments.

3. MARGIN
    The margin is the edge or border of the lesion. The descriptors of margin, like the descriptors of
    shape, are important predictors of whether a mass is benign or malignant.
    a. Circumscribed (historically, “well-defined” or “sharply-defined”)
       A circumscribed margin is one that is well defined, with an abrupt transition between the
       lesion and the surrounding tissue. For US, to describe a mass as circumscribed, its entire mar-
       gin must be sharply defined. Most circumscribed lesions have round or oval shapes.

```

giant fibroadenoma. Giant fibroadenoma is defined as being 5 cm or greater in longest dimension.

lateral image. (Image courtesy of Ellen B. Mendelson, MD)

3. MARGIN
b. Not Circumscribed
    If any portion of the margin is NOT CIRCUMSCRIBED, the mass should be characterized as “not
    circumscribed.” A mass that is NOT CIRCUMSCRIBED may further be described as having indis-
    tinct, angular, microlobulated, spiculated, or any combination of these margin descriptors. “Ir-
    regular” is not used to group these marginal attributes because irregular describes the shape
    of a mass.
    i. Indistinct
       There is no clear demarcation of the entire margin or any portion of the margin from the
       surrounding tissue. The boundary is poorly defined, and the significant feature is that the
       mass is NOT CIRCUMSCRIBED. This is meant to include “echogenic rim” (historically, echo-
       genic halo) because one may not be able to distinguish between an indistinct margin and
       one that displays an echogenic rim.

4. ECHO PATTERN
    The echogenicity of most benign and malignant masses is hypoechoic compared with mam-
    mary fat. While many completely echogenic masses are benign, prospective assessment as
    benign has greater dependency on marginal circumscription. Although the echo pattern
    contributes with other feature categories to the assessment of a breast lesion, echogenicity
    alone has little specificity.

    d. Hypoechoic
       The term “hypoechoic” is defined relative to subcutaneous fat; hypoechoic masses, less

    Isoechogenicity is defined as having the same echogenicity as subcutaneous fat. Isoechoic
       masses may be relatively inconspicuous, particularly when they are situated within an area of
       fat lobules. This may limit the sensitivity of US, especially at screening, in which the presence
       and location of such a mass is not known at the time of examination.

5. POSTERIOR ACOUSTIC FEATURES
Posterior acoustic features represent the attenuation characteristics of a mass with respect to its
    acoustic transmission. Attenuation (shadowing) and enhancement are additional attributes of
    masses, mostly of secondary rather than primary predictive value..
    a. No Posterior Acoustic Features
    No shadowing or enhancement is present deep to the mass; the echogenicity of the area
       immediately behind the mass is not different from that of adjacent tissue at the same depth.

```
Figure 79 — POSTERIOR ACOUSTIC FEATURES: NONE. Fibroadenoma located within fibroglandular
tissue is adjacent to the pectoral muscle in this 35-year-old woman. Although proximity to the pectoral

       Sound transmission is unimpeded in its passage through the mass. Enhancement appears as
       a column that is more echogenic (whiter) deep to the mass. One criterion for cyst diagnosis
       is enhancement. Homogeneous solid lesions, including high-grade carcinomas, may also
       show enhancement.

5. POSTERIOR ACOUSTIC FEATURES
    c. Shadowing
    Shadowing is attenuation of the acoustic transmission. Sonographically, the area posterior to
       the mass appears darker. At the edges of curved masses, acoustic velocity changes and thin
       shadows are seen. This refractive edge shadowing is of no significance and should be distin-
       guished from central shadowing, which is a property of the mass.
    Shadowing is associated with fibrosis, with or without an underlying carcinoma. Postsurgical
       scars, fibrous mastopathy and many cancers with or without a desmoplastic response will show
       posterior acoustic shadowing. Macrocalcifications can also attenuate sound. Similar to a vertical
       (taller-than-wide) orientation, shadowing is a feature more helpful when present than when
       absent. Many cancers will exhibit enhancement or no change in posterior features, particularly
       those that are high grade.

d. Combined Pattern
```
```
Some lesions have more than one pattern of posterior attenuation. For example, a fibroade-
noma containing a large calcification may demonstrate shadowing posterior to the calcified
area but enhancement of the tissues deep to the uncalcified portion. A combined pattern
of posterior features also may be seen in lesions that are evolving. One such example is a
post-lumpectomy seroma, which enhances posteriorly. As the fluid is resorbed and scarring
develops, the features of fibrosis become evident as spiculation of the margins and posterior
acoustic shadowing.

**C. Calcifications**

```
Calcifications have been poorly characterized with US compared with mammography, but they can
be recognized as echogenic foci, particularly when in a mass. High-frequency, high-resolution trans-
ducers in current use can depict intraductal calcifications well, particularly if they are superficial, and
groups of microcalcifications concentrated in fibroglandular tissue can be recognized and biopsied
with ultrasound guidance.
Note that calcifications that are obviously benign need not be reported, especially if the interpreting
physician is concerned that the referring clinician or patient might infer anything other than absolute
confidence in benignity were such calcifications described in the report.
Calcifications will attenuate the acoustic beam and cause shadowing. The larger the calcifications,
the more likely they will be depicted at ultrasound.

1. CALCIFICATIONS IN A MASS

```
Calcifications embedded in a mass may be well depicted at US, but their morphology will not be
as readily discernable as at mammography. These small hyperechoic foci will be more conspicu-
ous in a hypoechoic mass than within a volume of fibroglandular tissue. Unless calcifications are
grouped very close together or are individually coarse, they will not attenuate the US beam.
```
```
Figure 89 — CALCIFICATIONS IN A MASS. Located in a fatty breast, this calcified fibroadenoma is seen
to contain CALCIFICATIONS of varying size within it. These calcifications are too small to attenuate the
beam, so they do not cause shadowing (a and b). On the right side of the split screen image (b), the
calcifications are depicted with a calcification-enhancing algorithm, but the gray-scale images show the
calcific particles more clearly. (Images courtesy of Marcela Böhm-Vélez, MD)

2. CALCIFICATIONS OUTSIDE OF A MASS

```
Calcifications situated in fat or fibroglandular tissue are less conspicuous at US than when pres-
ent within a mass. Small echogenic flecks grouped in tissue may sometimes be identified because
they have patterns different from those of acoustic speckle and transversely sectioned Cooper’s
ligaments or pectoral muscle fascicles. Because they occupy too small a portion of the acoustic
beam, individual calcifications that are not coarse will not shadow. If calcifications are sufficiently
numerous for a pattern to be discerned, they may be perceived as grouped in the area of tissue
being examined with US.
When small calcifications within or outside a mass are seen well enough to target, ultrasound may
be used to provide imaging guidance for percutaneous biopsy, preferably using a vacuum-assisted
biopsy device. Specimen radiography should always be obtained to verify removal of the targeted
calcifications. A marker clip should be placed at the biopsy site, and its location demonstrated on
postbiopsy craniocaudal and 90º lateral mammographic images.
```
```
Figure 91 — CALCIFICATIONS OUTSIDE OF A MASS. US imaging was performed to look for a mass
in which mammographically detected CALCIFICATIONS might be embedded. In this 53-year-old
patient, no mass is seen within the dense fibroglandular tissue surrounding the calcifications
(arrow). Assessment at mammography was suspicious (category 4B), but depiction of some

```
Effects of a mass on its surroundings include architectural distortion, which may be manifested by
tethering of the tissue around the mass, disruption or obliteration of normal tissue planes by an
infiltrating lesion, and straightening or thickening of Cooper’s ligaments, and an echogenic rim. Non-
specific findings of breast edema and skin thickening may also be depicted, caused by inflammatory
carcinoma, radiation therapy, lymphedema, mastitis, trauma, superior vena cava obstruction or a
systemic process such as congestive heart failure, chronic renal failure, or anasarca. In addition, color
and power Doppler findings may indicate blood flow, which could be helpful in characterizing a
sonogrpahically visible lesion.

2. DUCT CHANGES

```
Ducts normally arborize in a smooth, regular, stepwise fashion, becoming progressively narrow-
er in caliber from the base of the nipple distally into the parenchyma. Abnormal duct changes
are manifested by cystic dilatation of a duct or ducts involving irregularities in caliber and/or
arborization, extension of duct(s) to or from a malignant mass, or the presence of an intraductal
mass, thrombus, or detritus.

5. VASCULARITY

```
To describe a mass or other lesion as hypovascular or hypervasacular, one must reference a con-
tralateral normal area or unaffected site in the same breast as the basis for comparison. No vas-
cular pattern is specific for any particular diagnosis. Both power and color Doppler are highly
dependent on technical factors, and it is important not to use vascularity as the only diagnostic
feature in interpretation. Malignant lesions may not be hypervascular, while some benign le-
sions, such as papillomas and inflammatory processes, may be highly vascular.
a. Avascular
Cysts are the most common avascular lesion. Some solid masses also have little or no vascu-
larity. However, technical factors such as sensitivity settings for color Doppler (pulse repetition
frequency should be set for low flow) may suppress the display of vascularity, falsely making
a lesion appear avascular. Additionally, vigorous compression may occlude small vessels; so
when scanning with color or power Doppler, little or no pressure should be applied.
```
```

of heterogeneous echogenicity, containing small cysts, is AVASCULAR. It had increased in size
over time and biopsy was advised. The absence of vascularity does not change the morphologic
analysis of the mass or its assessment. Histopathology: pseudoangiomatous stromal hyperplasia
(PASH). (Image courtesy of Ellen B. Mendelson, MD)

display an orderly or disorderly pattern within the mass. Abnormal flow patterns also may be
found in breast tissue without the presence of a mass.

6. ELASTICITY ASSESSMENT

```
Stiffness as a feature of masses may be considered along with their much more important mor-
phologic characteristics. This feature may be elicited either by manual compression of the mass
(“strain”) or by introduced ultrasonic energy into a mass (“shear wave”). Cancers are expected
to be hard, and benign lesions softer, although as with all other sonographic criteria, there is
overlap. Determination of the predictive value of various measurements of tissue stiffness is an
area of current research for both strain and shear wave elastographic methods. Most methods
involve quantitation through placement of regions of interest (ROI) in normal tissue, such as sub-
cutaneous fat, or lesion-free tissue at the same depth as a lesion, whereby stiffness ratios can
be calculated or an absolute stiffness value of the lesion may be measured in kPa or m/sec. The
United States Food and Drug Adminsitration (FDA) has not approved stiffness quantitation, so
commercially available elastographic applications are able to depict stiffness only qualitatively
through a color spectrum or gray scale, with hard assigned at one end of the scale and soft at the
other. As research continues, some of the BI-RADS® descriptors listed below may be validated,
others rejected, and new descriptors identified. Appearance of the color overlay may be spe-
cific to the elastographic method. Standardization of the color scale will diminish confusion and
help prevent misinterpretation. Descriptors that are applicable to all methods and all systems are
SOFT, INTERMEDIATE, and HARD.
It must be emphasized that the ultrasonic criteria of shape, margin, and echogenicity are far
more predictive for malignancy than “hardness” or “softness” and elastography evaluation
should not override the more predictive morphologic features of malignancy for patient man-
agement. Elastography has been included in the lexicon because it is available as a feature on
many modern ultrasound units. Thus, the committee feels that a description of the terminology
used, as well basic principles of the technology is important if only to place this technique in
proper perspective.

Until color coding is standardized, always check the color or black-and-white scale for the
labeling of soft and hard. While blue is recommended to symbolize soft, some equipment
manufacturers use red or another color as their default setting for soft. When a gray scale is
used, white most often indicates soft.

blue (soft, as per the color scale). The gray scale image below the shear wave representation shows
spiculation extending from the mass into an echogenic rim, with blurring of the fat plane anterior to
the mass by the advancing tumor. Given that the predictive value of lesion morphology is superior
to that of lesion elasticity, the assessment of this case should be suspicious. (Image courtesy of Ellen B.

Diagnosis and management of cystic breast lesions are addressed in detail in the Guidance
    Chapter. A simple cyst has four features: it is circumscribed, round or oval, anechoic, and shows

cysts, all will not be in the same plane and
margins may not be sharp. For similar masses
in proximity, measurement of the depth from
the skin to the anterior aspect of the mass can

3. COMPLICATED CYSTS
    These are masses that contain homogeneous low-level internal echoes. These echoes may have
    a layered appearance that may shift slowly with changes in the patient’s position. A complicated
    cyst also may contain echogenic foci that appear to scintillate as they shift in position.

```
Note: Presence of a discrete solid component (including solid mural nodules) should
cause what otherwise might be considered a complicated cyst to be described as a
COMPLEX CYSTIC AND SOLID MASS. In the past, COMPLICATED and COMPLEX cystic
and solid masses were confused, because this important distinction was not respected
in reporting.
```

4. MASS IN OR ON SKIN
    These benign masses are usually clinically apparent and include sebaceous or epidermal inclu-
    sion cysts, keloids, moles, pimples, neurofibromas, and accessory nipples. Rarely, a mass in the
    skin is found to be a metastasis, particularly in the setting of a mastectomy scar, but then clinical
    information about the primary tumor should be available to guide image interpretation. It is im-
    portant to recognize the interface between skin and parenchyma and to establish that the mass
    is at least partially within the two thin echogenic bands of skin.

```

and b, orthogonal views). The skin layers enclosing the mass are best seen on (b) (arrows). With use
of a gel offset or offset pad, a stalk can sometimes be seen through which the fatty contents of a
sebaceous cyst are occasionally extruded. (Image courtesy of Ellen B. Mendelson, MD)

5. FOREIGN BODY INCLUDING IMPLANTS
    Foreign bodies include marker clips, coils, wires, catheter sleeves, injected or leaked silicone, metal
    or glass related to trauma, and implants. History is usually helpful in establishing the presence and
    nature of foreign matter within the patient. Silicone within the parenchyma has a characteristic
    “snowstorm” appearance at US, depicted as echogenic noise, which propagates posterior to the
    mass and obscures deep structures. Extravasated silicone or silicone gel bleed can travel through
    lymphatics and lodge in lymph nodes, which then exhibit similar characteristics.

poor sound penetration. Note that although US may identify cases of intracapsular rupture of a
silicone implant, MRI is more sensitive. (Image courtesy of Marcela Böhm-Vélez, MD)

6. LYMPH NODES — INTRAMAMMARY

```
These are circumscribed oval masses that often are reniform and contain hilar fat. Lymph nodes
exist throughout the breast, but they are most commonly seen in the upper outer quadrant (es-
pecially axillary tail) because they normally are larger the closer they are located to the axilla. The
usual size of normal intramammary lymph nodes ranges from 3 to 4 mm up to approximately 1
cm. Whether present within the breast or axilla, lymph nodes have a distinctive appearance, with
a hypoechoic cortex and echogenic fatty hilus.
```

7. LYMPH NODES — AXILLARY
Enlarged axillary lymph nodes may warrant comment, clinical correlation and additional evalu-
    ation, especially if new or considerably larger or rounder when compared to previous examina-
    tion. Although there is no specific agreed-upon measurement, a normal axillary lymph node
    may be up to 2 cm in longest dimension, and contain hyperechoic fatty hilar areas. Lymph nodes
    much larger than 2 cm may be normal when a very thin cortical rim is seen around a massive
    collection of hilar fat. A lymph node with no fatty hilum or with a compressed fatty hilum may
    be abnormal, whereas depiction of a cortical bulge or cortical area of altered echogenicity sug-
    gests the presence of metastasis. However, there is no specific sonographic feature that reliably
    distinguishes a nodal metastasis from a benign reactive node. Because of individual variability in
    size and number of axillary lymph nodes, assessment of side-to-side symmetry may be helpful.
Following is an outline of the parameters that may be used to characterize a lymph node at US.
    a. Size
    b. Shape
    i. Oval
    ii Round
    iii. Irregular
    c. Cortical thickening
       i. Uniform, concentric: be wary of oblique angle of insonation as the explanation for corti-
          cal thickening, both concentric and focal. Real-time scanning should resolve the normal-
          abnormal.
    ii Focal
    d. Margin
       i. Circumscribed
    ii Not circumscribed
    e. Hilar compression or displacement
    Note that the presence of fat in a nodal hilus does not exclude metastatic involvement; the
       hilar fat may be compressed and displaced by the metastasis. Replacement of a node by tu-
       mor may be gradual, best detected by interval change. However, images of normal-appear-
       ing lymph nodes in an axilla rarely are recorded at US (because they are characteristically
       benign), so it may not be possible to assess for interval sonographic change. On the other
       hand, increasing nodal size at mammography may be a cause for concern and underlie a
       recommendation for biopsy. In this case, it is important to measure the node in the same,
       or similar, projection on the current and previous mammograms.

9. POSTSURGICAL FLUID COLLECTION

```
(For implants, see Special Cases, item 5: Foreign Body) The only postsurgical sonographic findings that
are characteristically benign involve fluid collections, especially postoperative seroma (entirely
cystic, however, also at times, containing retained blood products which are mobile on real-time
evaluation). Most other postsurgical findings, especially those involving scar tissue, usually display
suspicious sonographic findings such as posterior shadowing, hypoechogenicity, an irregular and
occasionally spiculated lateral margin, and architectural distortion (all of which are described and
displayed elsewhere in this lexicon), such that repeat biopsy may be averted only if there is a clini-
cal history of previous surgery with a skin scar apparent by visual inspection at the location of the
sonographic findings. Postsurgical scars commonly evolve over time, usually contracting as they
develop marginal irregularity and spiculation; these interval changes are observed much more
commonly at mammography than at US because postsurgical mammography is performed much
more frequently than US. The common postsurgical changes of edema and skin thickening, which
tend to decrease in extent and severity over time, are depicted equally well at mammography and
US; these are considered to be benign unless accompanied by more suspicious findings, given the
history of recent surgery. The remaining postsurgical changes that are visible at US are more accu-
rately assessed at mammography. This includes almost all cases of fat necrosis, because the oil cyst
is characteristically benign at mammography (but not US), whether solitary or multiple, whether
calcified or noncalcified. Hence, when fat necrosis is suspected at US, and also when other more
suspicious sonographic features are displayed that potentially represent fat necrosis, the next step
before rendering a final assessment should be correlation with a concurrent mammography ex-
amination that likely will justify a benign (category 2) assessment that cannot be made at US.

III. REPORTING SYSTEM


### FIFTH EDITION — 2013


### BI-RADS® ATLAS — BREAST ULTRASOUND

**A. REPORT ORGANIZATION**

```
The report should be concise and organized using a structure such as that provided in Table 2. As-
sessments and management recommendations are discussed in item B of this chapter on the report-
ing system, as well as in the Guidance chapter and in answer to some specific questions included
among the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ’s).
The indication for examination, relevant clinical history, and pertinent risk factor information should
be clearly stated. If the study is performed for follow-up of a specific mass or area of concern, this
should be described. The dates of any comparison examinations should be specified. As detailed in
the General Considerations section on Labeling and Measurement (p. ), when a specific sonographic
finding is documented by recording a complete set of images, the longest horizontal dimension
should be reported first, followed by the vertical measurement, and last, the orthogonal horizontal
dimension. Multiple simple cysts or a combination of multiple simple and complicated cysts need
not be reported individually. If any lesions have been biopsied previously, this should be noted to-
gether with the prior biopsy results, if known. Correlation of any clinical, mammographic, and MRI
findings with the sonographic findings should be specifically stated in the report. For diagnostic
evaluations involving US characterization of mammographic abnormalities or confirmation of a
mass suspected but not delineated mammographically, a single report integrating the two modali-
ties will clearly communicate a final assessment based on the highest likelihood of malignancy and
appropriate management recommendations.
```
```
Consistent use of BI-RADS® descriptors for US, as for mammography and MRI, helps in lesion as-
sessment and clarifies communication with physicians and patients. Also, structured, software-
based reporting should be based on BI-RADS® terminology.
```
```
For coding and reimbursement, consider the advisability of splitting the report combining the
findings of two or more concurrently performed imaging modalities or procedures into specific
sections or paragraphs, one for each type of examination. However, a single assessment and
recommendation for patient management should reflect integration of the findings of all of the
imaging studies. Note that an assessment based on the highest level of suspicion or the most
specific findings will have the greatest clinical usefulness.

### FIFTH EDITION — 2013

### 1. INDICATION FOR EXAMINATION

```
Reason for performance of the examination should be stated briefly at the beginning of
the report. The most common indications for breast US are confirmation and character-
ization of a palpable mass or mammographic or MRI abnormality, guidance of interven-
tional procedures, and as the initial imaging technique for young, pregnant, and lactating
patients. Additional applications are listed in the ACR Practice Guideline for the Perfor-
mance of the Breast Ultrasound Examination and include extent of disease evaluation
supplementing mammography in high-risk women who are not candidates for breast
MRI or who have no easy access to MRI, and in breast imaging practices that provide the
service, supplementary whole-breast screening in order to increase cancer detection in
asymptomatic women with mammographically dense breasts.
```
2. STATEMENT OF SCOPE AND TECHNIQUE OF BREAST US EXAMINATION
    The scope of examination and technique used should be stated, for example, whether the
    examination was directed or “targeted” to a specific location, or whether it was performed
    for supplementary screening. It is important, since US is a real-time examination, to indi-
    cate who performed the examination (sonographer, sonographer and physician, physician
    alone) or whether an automated whole-breast scanning system was used. If a lesion was
    evaluated with color or power Doppler or (less likely) with strain or shear wave elastogra-
    phy, observations relevant to the interpretation should be reported.
    In certain situations, it may be beneficial to describe the position of the patient during the
    examination. (For example: “The breasts were imaged in both supine and lateral decubitus posi-
    tions.” or “The patient was imaged in seated position, the position in which she feels the left breast
    thickening best.”)
    Automated whole breast scanners that acquire 3-D are available for clinical use and can be
    formatted in three planes. These scanners depict the entire breast in coronal, transverse,
    and sagittal planes, with the coronal view similar to the coronal MRI view. Reporting of
    these studies are works in progress, but where possible the interpretation structure out-
    lined in Table 2 and the reporting procedures described above should be followed.
3. SUCCINCT DESCRIPTION OF THE OVERALL BREAST COMPOSITION
Tissue composition patterns can be estimated more easily in the large FOV’s of auto-
    mated US scans but can also be discerned in the small FOV of a handheld US scan in the
    area around a lesion or when no abnormality is present in an area of concern. Loosely cor-
    responding to the four density descriptors of mammography and to the four fibroglan-
    dular tissue descriptors of MRI, are the three US descriptors, homogeneous background
    echotexture-fat, homogeneous background echotexture-fibroglandular, and heterogeneous
    background echotexture, which are described in the Tissue Composition section of the US
    lexicon. At US, breast tissue composition is determined by echogenicity. Subcutaneous
    fat, the tissue relative to which echogenicity is compared, is medium gray and darker
    than fibroglandular tissue, which is light gray. Heterogeneous breasts show an admixture
    of hypoechoic and more echogenic areas. Careful real-time scanning will help differenti-
    ate a small hypoechoic area of normal tissue from a mass.


### BI-RADS® ATLAS — BREAST ULTRASOUND

### 4. CLEAR DESCRIPTION OF ANY IMPORTANT FINDINGS

```
The description of important findings should be made, in order of clinical relevance, using
lexicon terminology and should include:
a. Characterization of a mass using the morphological descriptors of shape, margin, and
orientation. Note should be made of the lesion’s effect on the surrounding tissue, such
as architectural distortion. Feature categories such as posterior features and echogenici-
ty, and techniques such as color or power Doppler and elastography may contribute
information to the analysis, but only pertinent positives need to be described. Recogni-
tion of “special case” findings, such as simple and complicated cysts, clustered micro-
cysts, intramammary lymph nodes, and foreign bodies, should simplify interpretation.
In reporting screening examinations in asymptomatic women, as per mammography,
characteristically benign findings need not be described in the US report.
b. For important findings, lesion size should be given in at least two dimensions; three di-
mensions are preferable, especially if the volume of a mass is compared with one or
more previous examinations. It is not necessary to report the measurements of every
small simple cyst, and if numerous cysts are present, especially in both breasts, location
and measurements of the largest cyst in each breast will suffice.
If a mass is measured, images should be recorded with and without calipers. Marginal
characteristics are one of the most important criteria to be applied in assessing the likeli-
hood of malignancy of a mass, and particularly with small masses, caliper markings may
obscure the margin, hindering analysis.
c. Location of the lesion(s) should be indicated using a consistent and reproducible system
such as clock-face and distance from the nipple. When more than one mass or abnor-
mality is located in the same scan frame or in the same locale, measurement of the dis-
tance from the skin to the center of the mass may help to differentiate one lesion from
another. This measurement may be particularly useful when one mass is singled out for
biopsy and others are depicted in the field.
There may be variability within breast imaging practices, and members of a group practice
should agree upon a consistent policy for documenting lesion location on subsequent
examinations. In some practices, for all examinations that follow the initial US study, the
lesion location annotation will be repeated without change. Other breast imagers may
report a different location to signify the same lesion but indicate in their reports that the
lesion is now seen at another clock-face position and distance from the nipple (these dif-
ferences are often related to positioning and technique). A more complete discussion of
this common scenario is provided in the Frequently Asked Questions. [LINK TO FAQ #7]
d. As at mammography, multiple bilateral circumscribed masses usually are assessed as
benign (category 2) unless one mass has different imaging features than all the oth-
ers. In the unusual circumstance in which the interpreting physician chooses to describe
multiple benign-appearing masses individually in the US report, the masses should be
listed by breast, by location within in the breast, and by size. The reader of the report will
```

### FIFTH EDITION — 2013

```
be less confused, and if surveillance is suggested as management, the performer of the
subsequent examination will appreciate a list rather than verbose text. For bilateral find-
ings, describe all the findings in each breast in its own paragraph.
```
5. COMPARISON TO PREVIOUS EXAMINATION(S), INCLUDING CORRELATION WITH PHYSI-
    CAL, MAMMOGRAPHY, OR MRI FINDINGS
Breast US should be correlated with physical findings, mammography, MRI or other imag-
    ing studies, if performed. If no statement of comparison is included in the US report, it will
    be assumed that no comparison was made. Note that some report templates include a
    “comparison” heading, in which word “none” (if appropriate) may be entered.
When correlating US findings with those seen at mammography and/or MRI, the operator
    performing handheld scanning should correlate the size and location of lesions, and also to
    match the type and arrangement of tissues surrounding the lesion in order to reduce the
    likelihood of misregistration (identifying a different lesion or lesions at different imaging
    modalities). In doing this, allowance for positional changes should be made going from
    upright with mammography and prone with MRI to supine or supine-oblique with US. If
    it is determined that a sonographic finding corresponds to a palpable abnormality, or to a
    mammographic or MRI finding, this should be stated explicitly in the US report. If the US
    finding is new or has no correlate, this should also be stated in the report.
If the US examination was performed as part of a surveillance protocol to assess a previous-
    ly identified finding, or if the finding was reported on a previous examination, the current
    report should describe any changes. An increase of 20% or more in the longest dimension
    of a probably benign solid mass within 6 months may prompt biopsy [11]. An increase of
    only 1–2 mm in lesion size may be related to differences in scanning technique or patient
    positioning.
6. COMPOSITE REPORTS
    When more than one type of examination is performed concurrently (on the same day),
    it is preferable that the examinations be reported together, with the findings for each ex-
    amination described in separate paragraphs, with an overall assessment and management
    recommendations for the combined examinations. In general, when the assessments for
    two examinations differ, the overall assessment (and concordant management recommen-
    dations) should reflect the more abnormal of the individual assessments, according to the
    following hierarchy of increasing abnormality: category 1, 2, 3, 6, 0, 4, 5.
    Exceptions to this rule occur when the characteristically benign features of a given imag-
    ing finding on one examination supersede the less specifically benign features of the same

```
The report should conclude with a concise summary of pertinent US findings with a final as-
sessment using BI-RADS® US categories 1 through 6 and the phrases associated with them.
If report of a US examination is integrated with that of a concurrently performed mammog-
raphy examination, the combined final assessment should reflect the highest likelihood of
malignancy assessed at the 2 examinations. Clear and consistent communication is a goal
that can be achieved for breast US by using the same assessment categories and similar
wording described in the BI-RADS® mammography section.
In some cases, the interpreting physician may render an incomplete assessment (category 0)
in order to request additional examination(s) such as mammography, MRI, comparison with
previous but currently unavailable examinations, or additional physican-performed real-time
scanning after either sonographer-produced real-time or automated whole-breast screening
US examination.
```
8. MANAGEMENT

```
Management recommendations should be included in every report. Clear recommendations
should be made as to the next course of action. Recommendations may include routine age-
appropriate screening, surveillance imaging for a probably benign mass, annual follow-up after
percutaneous or surgical biopsy, and clinical management. If an imaging-guided interventional
procedure is recommended, the type of imaging for the procedure might also be suggested, as
for example, stereotactic, US, or MRI guidance.

a. Assessment is Incomplete
Category 0: Incomplete — Need Additional Imaging Evaluation and/or Prior Images for
Comparison (See Guidance chapter)
There is a finding for which additional imaging evaluation is needed. This is almost always used
in a screening situation. In this context, additional imaging evaluation includes the recording of
(nonstandard) US images to supplement the standard images recorded for a normal screening
examination. The interpreting physician should be aware that complete documentation of any
sonographic finding(s) by recording multiple images of the finding will cause the screening com-
ponent of a US examination to be considered audit-positive (that is, equivalent to a category 0
assessment), whether or not such a separate assessment appears in the US report that is based
on interpretation of the additional recorded images.
Under certain circumstances, assessment category 0 may be used in a diagnostic US report, such
as when equipment or personnel are not immediately available to perform a needed concurrent
diagnostic mammography examination, or when the patient is unable or unwilling to wait for
completion of a full diagnostic examination. Category 0 should not be used for diagnostic breast
imaging findings that warrant further evaluation with MRI. Rather, the interpreting physician
should issue a final assessment in a report that is made before the MRI examination is performed.
```

### BI-RADS® ATLAS — BREAST ULTRASOUND

```
In most circumstances and when feasible, if a screening US examination is not assessed as nega-
tive or benign, the current examination should be compared to prior examination(s), if any exist.
The interpreting physician should use judgment on how vigorously to attempt obtaining prior
examinations, given the likelihood of success of such an endeavor and the likelihood that com-
parison will affect the final assessment. In this context, it is important to note that comparison to
previous examination(s) may be irrelevant when a finding is inherently suspicious for malignancy.
Category 0 should be used for prior image comparison only when such comparison is required
to make a final assessment. When category 0 is used in the context of awaiting prior examina-
tions for comparison, there should be in place a tracking system guaranteeing with 100% reliabil-
ity that a final assessment will be made within 30 days (preferably sooner) even if prior examina-
tions do not become available. Some breast imaging practices may reasonably choose never to
use category 0 in the context of awaiting prior examinations simply because they do not have
a 100% reliable tracking system. If a US examination is assessed as category 0 in the context of
awaiting prior examinations and then the prior examinations do become available, an adden-
dum to the initial US report should be issued, including a revised assessment. For auditing pur-
poses, the revised assessment should replace the initial assessment.
A need for previous studies to determine appropriate management might also temporarily defer
a final assessment.
```
b. Assessment is Complete — Final Categories

```
Category 1: Negative (See Guidance chapter)
There is nothing to comment on. This is a “normal” examination.
Category 2: Benign (See Guidance chapter)
Like category 1, this is a “normal” assessment, but here the interpreter chooses to describe a
benign finding in the US report. For example, the interpreter may choose to describe one or
more simple cysts, intramammary lymph nodes, postsurgical fluid collections, breast implants,
or complicated cysts/probable fibroadenomas that are unchanged for at least 2 or 3 years, while
still concluding that there is no sonographic evidence of malignancy. On the other hand, the
interpreter may choose not to describe such findings, in which case the examination should be
assessed as negative (category 1).
Note that both category 1 and category 2 assessments indicate that there is no sonographic
evidence of malignancy. Both should be followed by the management recommendation for rou-
tine age-appropriate screening. The difference is that category 2 should be used when describ-
ing one or more specific benign sonographic findings in the report, whereas category 1 should
be used when no such findings are described (even if such findings are present).
Category 3: Probably Benign (See Guidance chapter)
Assessment category 3, probably benign, is NOT an indeterminate category used simply when
the radiologist is unsure whether to render a benign (BI-RADS® category 2) or suspicious (BI-
RADS® category 4) assessment, but one that is reserved for specific imaging findings known
to have a greater than essentially 0% but ≤ 2% likelihood of representing malignancy. For US,
there is strong evidence that complicated cysts have likelihoods of malignancy in the defined
(≤ 2%) probably benign range, for which short-interval (6-month) follow-up sonography and
then periodic sonographic surveillance may represent appropriate management [3]. Similar
```

### FIFTH EDITION — 2013

```
data have been reported for clustered microcysts, but these data are less strong because they
involve many fewer cases [3]. There also is robust evidence that solid masses with circum-
scribed margin, oval shape, and parallel orientation, most commonly fibroadenomas, have a ≤
2% likelihood of malignancy, although the strength of the supporting data primarily involves
masses that also appear circumscribed at mammography. The use of assessment category 3
for sonographic findings other than these three should be considered only if the radiologist
has personal experience to justify a watchful-waiting approach, preferably involving observa-
tion of a sufficient number of cases of an additional sonographic finding to suggest a likeli-
hood of malignancy within the defined (≤ 2%) probably-benign range.
This edition of BI-RADS® also emphasizes the recommendation that category 3 assessments
should be made only after completion of a full diagnostic breast imaging examination. There are
two major advantages to the recommended approach: (1) more prompt identification of truly
benign findings (simple cysts, some intramammary lymph nodes, etc), and (2) more prompt iden-
tification of some rapidly-growing cancers. BI-RADS® 3 at screening is considered as a positive
rather than negative examination, and the use of BI-RADS® 3 at screening will no longer serve as a
(misleading) approach to reduce the recall rate.
For category 3 assessments, the initial short-term follow-up interval is usually 6 months, involv-
ing the breast(s) containing the probably benign finding(s). Assuming stability at this 6-month
examination, a category 3 assessment again is rendered with a management recommendation
for a second short-interval follow-up examination in 6 months. Again assuming stability at this
second short-interval follow-up, the examination is once more assessed as category 3, but now
the recommended follow-up interval usually is lengthened to 1 year due the already-observed
12-month stability. Note that although the 1-year follow-up coincides with the routine screening
interval in the United States, a category 3 assessment is rendered, to indicate that the period of
imaging surveillance is still underway. As with surveillance using mammography, after 2-3 years
of stability, the final assessment category should be changed to benign (BI-RADS® category 2).
Category 4: Suspicious (See Guidance chapter)
This category is reserved for findings that do not have the classic appearance of malignancy but
are sufficiently suspicious to justify a recommendation for biopsy. The ceiling for category 3 as-
sessment is a 2% likelihood of malignancy and the floor for category 5 assessment is 95%, so cat-
egory 4 assessments cover the wide range of likelihood of malignancy in between. Thus, almost
all recommendations for breast interventional procedures will come from assessments made us-
ing this category. By subdividing category 4 into 4A, 4B, and 4C, as recommended in and using
the cut points indicated in the Guidance chapter, it is hoped that patients and referring clinicians
will more readily make informed decisions on the ultimate course of action. An example of sepa-
rating the BI-RADS® assessment category from the management recommendation (new to Edi-
tion 5 — see “Follow-up and Outcome Monitoring” Section) occurs when a simple cyst, correctly
assessed as BI-RADS® 2, undergoes cyst aspiration for pain control. For auditing purposes this is a
positive, not a negative or benign, exam since intervention is recommended.
```

### BI-RADS® ATLAS — BREAST ULTRASOUND

```
Category 5: Highly Suggestive of Malignancy (See Guidance chapter)
```
```
These assessments carry a very high probability (≥ 95%) of malignancy. This category initially
was established to involve lesions for which one-stage surgical treatment could be considered
without preliminary biopsy, in an era when pre-operative wire localization was the primary
breast interventional procedure. Nowadays, given the widespread acceptance of imaging-guid-
ed percutaneous biopsy, one-stage surgery rarely if ever is performed. Rather, current oncologic
management almost always involves tissue diagnosis of malignancy via percutaneous tissue
sampling, to facilitate treatment options such as when sentinel node imaging is included in
surgical management or when neoadjuvant chemotherapy is administrered prior to surgery.
Therefore, the current rationale for using category 5 assessment is to identify lesions for which
any non-malignant percutaneous tissue diagnosis is considered discordant, resulting in the
recommendation for repeat (usually surgical) biopsy. Also note that whereas the Fourth Edi-
tion simply indicated as management that “appropriate action should be taken” for category 5
assessments, the Fifth Edition provides the more directed management recommendation, “bi-
opsy should be performed in the absence of clinical contraindication.” This new text unequivo-
cally specifies tissue diagnosis as the interpreting physician’s management recommendation for
category 5 assessments, appropriately and effectively transferring the burden of establishing a
contraindication to this recommendation to the referring clinician.
```
```
Category 6: Known Biopsy-Proven Malignancy (See Guidance chapter)
```
```
This category is reserved for examinations performed after biopsy proof of malignancy (imaging
performed after percutaneous biopsy but prior to surgical excision), in which there are no abnor-
malities other than the known cancer that might need additional evaluation.
```
**C. WORDING THE REPORT**

```
When performed concurrently, breast US examinations are sometimes reported separately from
mammography examinations and sometimes reported as part of a combined examination. In
both situations, the current examination should be COMPARED TO PRIOR EXAMINATION(S) when
appropriate. The INDICATION FOR EXAMINATION, such as screening or diagnostic (targeted),
should be stated. The report should be organized with a brief description of the COMPOSITION
of the breast and any pertinent FINDINGS, followed by the ASSESSMENT and MANAGEMENT REC-
OMMENDATIONS. Any verbal discussions between the interpreting physician and the referring clini-
cian or patient should be documented in the original report or in an addendum to the report.
```
```
The report should be succinct, using terminology from the latest approved lexicon without em-
bellishment. Definitions of lexicon terms for mammographic findings should not appear in the
report narrative. Following the impression section and the (concordant) management recom-
mendation section of the report, both the assessment category number and text for the assess-
ment category should be stated. Other aspects of the report should comply with the ACR Practice
Guideline for Communication of Diagnostic Imaging Findings. [12].

IV. GUIDANCE

```
Many substantive changes were incorporated into the ultrasound section of this edition of the
BI-RADS® Atlas to improve its clinical utility, and to supply a unified base for research involv-
ing breast imaging. This chapter expands on these changes as they appear in each part of the
ultrasound section and provides more complete explanations for the changes. What follows is
intended for guidance and is not meant to imply required standards of practice.
```

### FIFTH EDITION — 2013


### BI-RADS® ATLAS — BREAST ULTRASOUND

**A. BREAST ULTRASOUND LEXICON**

```
Since the 2003 edition of BI-RADS® was published, the practice of breast imaging has evolved further
into a more clinically oriented subspecialty of diagnostic radiology. Multimodality imaging and in-
terventions offer options to the breast imager in designing a work-up for many different diagnostic
scenarios. In addition, limited for decades to mammography and physical examination, screening ap-
proaches have broadened, with supplements to mammography utilizing MRI and/or US. Intervention-
al procedures guided by all imaging techniques are in common use, and diagnoses are rarely made
through more costly and invasive open surgical procedures. Percutaneous imaging-guided core and
vacuum-assisted biopsies provide most of the diagnoses, with relatively few facilities performing fine-
needle aspiration cytology and even fewer, open surgical procedures. In recognition of these changes,
several new sections have been added to this edition of BI-RADS® for US.
```
```
Detailed knowledge of normal anatomy is important in interpreting images of all organ systems, and
in all imaging modalities, more of the normal breast anatomy is routinely being documented. In the
mammography and MRI sections of this edition of the BI-RADS® Atlas, description of the variable bal-
ance of fat and fibroglandular tissue in normal breasts has been updated and discussed in detail. The
material under the heading Background Echotexture in the 2003 edition of BI-RADS® for US has been
expanded and the heading renamed Tissue Composition. Here we now include examples of the ob-
served spectrum of breast patterns, with wide differences in the fat-to-fibroglandular balance seen in
the normal breast. Unlike mammography, one need not state the breast composition in every breast
US report. However, especially for US examinations in which the admixture of fat and fibroglandular
tissue produces numerous acoustic interfaces and areas of artifactual shadowing, US may be more dif-
ficult to interpret. In these cases, at the discretion of the interpreting physician, it may be appropriate
to include a statement that the breast composition is heterogeneous, which may lower the sensitivity
of sonography. Although there are no data that document changes in the sensitivity of US for breasts
of different tissue composition, clinical experience suggests that this may be true. Further study of this
issue is encouraged; in order to yield reproducible, clinically relevant data. It is strongly recommended
that future research utilize the descriptors of breast tissue composition newly established in this edi-
tion of the BI-RADS® Atlas.
```
```
There are physiological changes that occur throughout life, reflective of hormonal shifts. Young nursing
mothers concerned about abscesses may come for evaluation of a red, tender area, and with US being
the preferred initial imaging examination, it is important for the breast imager to recognize the paren-
chymal findings of mastitis as distinct from the appearance of normal fibroglandular tissue stimulated
by the hormones supporting lactation. Examples of involutional changes after lactation and menopause
and the appearances of gynecomastia also have been added.
```
```
Sonographic correlates to mammographic breast density appear under the Tissue Composition head-
ing, obtained with both conventional high-resolution linear transducers as well as wider field-of-view
probes used in automated US systems. The multiplanar reconstructions provided by these automated
systems also make comparison with MRI more intuitive. The larger FOV also facilitates cross-modality
recognition of the various types of breast tissue composition, but correlation with mammography
and MRI is also possible with commonly used small FOV US techniques (5 cm in greatest dimension).
```
```
In the past, sonographic imaging of the male breast has been avoided by many breast imagers con-
cerned that one of several normal appearances of gynecomastia has feature characteristics of carci-
noma and will result in unnecessary biopsy. However, many men present with tender, palpable areas
behind the nipple. Mammography in most instances is definitive, but the expectation that palpable
```

### FIFTH EDITION — 2013

```
areas will be evaluated with US both in women and men has led to greater use of US for men, and we
have included gynecomastia (which resembles the developing breasts of adolescent girls) in Tissue
Composition, and the benign and malignant abnormalities found in male breasts within the appropri-
ate descriptors of the lexicon.
```
```
With careful attention to proper scanning technique and use of widely accepted interpretive criteria,
handheld US may be as reproducible and consistent as any other breast imaging technology [1]. New
material on image quality includes descriptions of transducer selection and proper positioning. Fields
of view, focal zone settings, gray scale gain, and contrast should be appropriately adjusted for each
patient. Ergonomics of scanning should be respected, and the appropriate table height, insonation
angles, and comfortable grasp of the probe housing should be chosen. Annotation recommenda-
tions are provided, and examples are shown of how and how not to measure masses. We include
examples of scans whose image quality is poor for various reasons, along with recommendations for
how they could be improved.
```
```
Nearly all of the cases selected to exemplify feature categories and their descriptors are shown in or-
thogonal views to emphasize that real-time scanning completely through a lesion in perpendicular
planes ensures that the mass has been seen in its entirety. Focal zone settings should be appropriately
placed and clearly indicated on the images, so they are included in the illustrations that we provide.
Because it also is important to evaluate the skin (normally 2 mm thick, except in the periareolar area
and inframammary fold where they may be thicker), our illustrations include the skin. Gel offsets are
used for the most superficial findings to keep skin lesions within the appropriate focal zone.
```
```
Techniques are available on most US systems to reduce artifacts. For example, spatial compounding
reduces speckle (or noise) and smoothes the image. Spatial compounding has been available on most
systems for many years, and most handheld scanning is currently done in a spatial compounding
mode.
```
```
Tissue harmonic imaging, which enhances contrast, is also available. It sharpens the margin of a mass
and is said to “clean out” low level echoes from cysts. However, care must be taken not to heighten
contrast so much that a poorly differentiated invasive cancer is called a cyst. Breast US should display
the numerous available shades of gray in order to depict the several individual anatomic components
of breast tissue—skin, fat, connective tissue, fibroglandular tissue, and ducts.
```
```
Several refinements have been made to the terminology used for assessment and management. In
previous editions of the BI-RADS® Atlas, management recommendations were included in the text
used to describe several of the assessment categories. In this edition, we have removed the manage-
ment recommendations from this text in order to provide more flexibility for several specific clinical
scenarios for which a seemingly discordant management recommendation might be appropriate
for a given assessment. However, except for these few scenarios, the management recommendation
should be fully concordant with the assessment. Assessment-management concordance is a hallmark
of appropriate interpretation. Deviating from this concordance invites confusion with the potential for
producing incorrect treatment. Although relatively uncommon, many clinical scenarios in which the
appropriate management recommendation may appear to be discordant with the proper BI-RADS®
assessment category are described in detail in the mammography section, and the reader is referred
there for a complete discussion. The few such scenarios that are specifically pertinent to breast US are
discussed among the frequently asked questions (FAQs) provided below.
```
```
While there is no statutory requirement to use BI-RADS® final assessment phrases in the reports of
breast ultrasound examinations, as there is for mammography under provisions of the Mammogra-
```

### BI-RADS® ATLAS — BREAST ULTRASOUND

phy Quality Standards Act (MQSA), using the same terminology as mammography is strongly encour-
aged. As discussed under the heading Report Organization, if both mammography and breast ultra-
sound are performed concurrently, results of the two modalities should be provided in an integrated
report, containing a single combined assessment and management recommendation(s), with the
most abnormal finding, or the finding that requires the most immediate attention, taking precedence.

For the vast majority of examinations, the BI-RADS® assessment reported for US should prompt the
same standard recommendations that apply to mammography (see Table 4, page ##). As in mam-
mography, the subdivision of assessment category 4 (suspicious) is optional although recommended.
This is designed to communicate to pathologists and referring physicians the relative level of suspi-
cion of the imaging findings, to facilitate improved patient care.

The Subcommittee on BI-RADS® Ultrasound has also made several changes in the feature analysis
parts of the lexicon:

	 Although there are several descriptors when the margin of a mass is not circumscribed, the key
distinction is whether the margin is circumscribed or not. In future research studies involving BI-
RADS®–US terminology, investigators are encouraged to report results at the circumscribed/not
circumscribed level. Additional analyses utilizing the subcategories of not circumscribed margin
(indistinct, angular, microlobulated, and spiculated) may also be reported.

	 Lesion boundary is no longer a major feature category (shape and margin remain major feature
categories). Since the presence of an echogenic transition zone (“echogenic rim” historically“
echogenic halo”) may be seen with malignancies and abscesses, its presence should be noted.
Additionally, since the absence of an echogenic transition zone is quite common and now con-
sidered to be of no diagnostic significance, the term “abrupt interface” has been dropped.

	 Simple and complicated cysts are included among the Special Cases. Since confusion may per-
sist on the distinction between “complicated cysts” and masses with “complex” echotexture, we
have refined the terminology to clarify these entities. Specifically, a complicated cyst represents
a cyst with debris, indicating that this is a finding highly likely to be benign. The “debris” is usually
unspecified, possibly proteinaceous or cellular, sometimes containing blood or pus. The echoes
visible within a complicated cyst should be homogeneously low-level echoes throughout, with
no mural nodules, thick septa, thick wall, or any other suggestion of a solid component. On real-
time evaluation, these echoes are seen to be mobile. Therefore, the only difference between a
complicated cyst and a simple cyst should be presence of internal, mobile echoes. The margin of
a cyst, simple or complicated, should be circumscribed, with no echogenic rim present. Compli-
cated cysts may also display fluid-fluid levels (with a straight or sigmoidal separation). What previ-
ously was called a “complex mass” should now be described as a “complex cystic and solid mass”
to indicate the mass contains a solid component. Such lesions usually are assessed as suspicious
(category 4), accompanied by a recommendation for biopsy [2].

	 Two other descriptors, architectural distortion and duct changes, are now listed as Associated Fea-
tures. This was done because such findings may be associated with a breast mass, or may stand
alone as findings when no other abnormality is present. Cooper’s ligament changes are a manifes-
tation of architectural distortion; this is now listed as a subset of architectural distortion. We em-
phasize that architectural distortion is an important feature that influences BI-RADS® assessments.
Many breast masses are found within the zone of fibroglandular tissue or at a fat-fibroglandular
junction. If the mass blurs a tissue plane between fat and fibroglandular tissue or if the mass pro-
duces distortion of the ducts, these findings may be termed architectural distortion.


### FIFTH EDITION — 2013

```
	 Vascularity within an anechoic mass suggests that the mass is solid, possibly a primary breast
cancer or metastatic lymph node. Although reporting the presence of vascularity can be help-
ful, its absence cannot be used to establish an anechoic or hypoechoic mass as a cyst. However,
absence of flow may support the diagnosis of cyst if the mass has the features of circumscribed
margin, oval shape, and is anechoic. This is why vascularity, as a supportive rather than primary
feature, is now listed among Associated Features.
```
```
Since most new ultrasound equipment has tissue stiffness assessment capability, elastography,
whether strain or shear wave, may be used (optionally) in lesion characterization. Research is
underway to determine the role of elastographic findings, if any, in lesion assessment and rec-
ommendations for management. In this edition of BI-RADS® we provide standardized terminol-
ogy for elastographic findings not to signify endorsement of this developing technology, but
rather to provide the framework for future research involving outcomes analysis. We strongly
recommend that future research utilize the descriptors for tissue stiffness endorsed in this edi-
tion of the BI-RADS® Atlas. Although there are many methods to assess tissue stiffness, nearly
all use a color scale or spectrum and some form of quantitation. (Quantitation is used widely
outside of the United States). The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently approved
m/s but not kPa as a unit of measure of lesion stiffness for shear wave elastography. Comparison
of lesion stiffness to the stiffness of normal subcutaneous fat is, as of this writing, unapproved
for either strain or shear wave imaging, although approval may be given at any time.
```
```
	 Special Cases are those with pathognomonic appearances. A simple cyst is one such lesion, and
the criteria for this designation are an anechoic, circumscribed, oval or round mass with imper-
ceptible wall, and posterior enhancement. Occasionally, simple cysts smaller than 8 mm may be
difficult to characterize, particularly when located deep in the breast [3]. Use of tissue harmonic
imaging may reduce artifactual internal echoes, although great care and caution are required not
to tune real echoes out of what appear to be cysts when using this contrast-modifying technique.
Posterior acoustic features such as enhancement may be subtle but are usually discernible with
small cysts even when multiple off-angle beams are used to generate the image (that is, spatial
compounding), and when small cysts are located adjacent to pectoral muscle.

### BI-RADS® ATLAS — BREAST ULTRASOUND

**B. PROBABLY BENIGN (CATEGORY 3) ASSESSMENTS**

```
It is well known that for mammography several specific findings have been validated by robust litera-
ture as being probably benign, with a likelihood of malignancy greater than essentially 0% but ≤ 2
%, hence appropriate for category 3 assessment and recommendation for surveillance imaging [5-8].
Several specific findings that may be appropriate for probably benign assessment at ultrasound are
proposed in this edition of the BI-RADS® Atlas. The literature supporting our proposals is not as robust
as exists for mammography, and in some cases it is so sparse as to involve only expert opinion rather
than data from prospective clinical studies. For all findings assessed as probably benign at US, the
surveillance protocol should be identical to that used for mammographically characterized lesions,
involving follow-up examinations at 6 months, 12 months, and 24 months, with the option to extend
the surveillance period to 36 months.
```
```
1) Circumscribed, oval, solid masses, parallel to the skin in orientation, hypoechoic to fat with no
posterior features or minimal posterior enhancement. There is robust evidence that these le-
sions, most of which represent fibroadenomas, have a ≤ 2% likelihood of malignancy, although
the strength of the supporting data primarily involves masses that also appear circumscribed at
mammography. One also may consider including palpable masses having these sonographic fea-
tures so long as they exhibit no mammographically suspicious findings [9,10], but the literature
for palpable masses is strong only for women younger than age 40, who comprise the majority
of studied cases and among whom the prior probability of malignancy is low. If there is interval
decrease in the size of a mass under surveillance as a probably benign finding, the mass should
be assessed as benign (category 2), and if such a mass completely resolves, a negative (category
1) assessment is appropriate. An increase in diameter of more than 20% in 6 months [11] or other
suspicious change should prompt assessment as suspicious(category 4), with recommendation
for biopsy. As with multiple bilateral mostly circumscribed masses at mammography [12], with
at least three overall and one in each breast, such findings seen only at US may be assessed as
benign, with a recommendation for routine screening.
2) Isolated, complicated cyst with uniform low-level echoes. The likelihood of malignancy has been
shown to be 4/1244 (0.3%) [4,17-20]. Across three series, 12% of masses thought to be complicat-
ed cysts proved to be solid, with 2/64 (3.1%) of these solid masses proving malignant [17,19,20].
This represents strong evidence that the likelihood of malignancy for an isolated complicated
cyst is greater than essentially 0% but ≤ 2%, hence appropriate for category 3 assessment at
US. As is the case for multiple bilateral mostly circumscribed masses at mammography, multiple
bilateral complicated cysts (at least three overall and one in each breast) seen only at US may be
assessed as benign, with a recommendation for routine screening.
3) Microlobulated or oval masses composed entirely of clustered microcysts. These findings may be
assessed as benign (category 2) when clearly composed of simple cysts. However, imaging surveil-
lance may be appropriate for smaller or deeper clustered microcysts, for which there is reduced
diagnostic certainty, with one malignancy (0.5%) reported among 216 such masses across multiple
centers [3,16,17,19,20]. The relatively small number of cases studied limits precision in estimating
the likelihood of malignancy to be ≤ 2%; the data would be more convincing if at least 500 cases
were studied.
4) A hyperechoic mass with central hypoechoic to anechoic components and surrounding edema is
consistent with but not diagnostic of fat necrosis. There are no published data indicating the likeli-
hood of malignancy for this combination of sonographic findings, so the decision to assess such
findings as probably benign (category 3) would be based only on expert opinion. However, whether
```

```
or not a history of trauma or prior surgery is elicited, the preferred approach is to correlate these
sonographic finding(s) with those visible at mammography, because (1) if a mass representing fat
necrosis is depicted at US, it also should be visible at mammography as an oil cyst, and (2) fat necrosis
presenting as oil cyst(s) has a characteristically benign mammographic appearance, whether or not
rim calcification is depicted. Therefore, virtually all such cases will confidently be assessed as benign
(category 2).
5) While refraction shadowing at the edges of fat lobules is often easily recognized as non-patho-
logic, posterior shadowing seen in two projections may pose problems. Careful scanning may
exclude the presence of an associated mass, and one should be able to dismiss the shadowing
as artifactual if it changes in appearance on the different views, with increase or decrease in
transducer pressure on the skin, and with alterations of the angle of insonation. So what should
be done if a confident benign assessment cannot be rendered? There are no published data in-
dicating the likelihood of malignancy for this sonographic scenario, so the decision to assess as
probably benign (category 3) would be based only on expert opinion. However, it is important to
realize that category 3 assessments should not be rendered because the interpreting physician
is unsure whether to assess as benign (category 2) or suspicious (category 4); in this situation, it
would be prudent to render a suspicious (category 4) assessment.
6) Architectural distortion thought to be due to post-surgical scar. Clinical history may be helpful
in this setting, and a track may be evident sonographically that can be followed to focally thick-
ened skin at the site of incision. However, there are no published data indicating the likelihood
of malignancy for sonographic findings thought to be due to post-surgical scar, so the decision
to assess as probably benign (category 3) would be based only on expert opinion. Furthermore,
such an assessment would be inadvisable without first correlating the sonographic findings with
those visible at mammography. Previous breast biopsy for benign disease rarely complicates or
alters interpretation at mammography [21].
In summary, among the six specific sonographic findings proposed as being appropriate for as-
sessment as probably benign (category 3) at US, there is strong evidence supporting the first two
(circumscribed oval solid parallel-oriented mass and complicated cyst), less strong evidence sup-
porting the third (clustered microcysts), and only expert opinion supporting the rest. Individual in-
terpreting physicians should be cautious about adopting an interpretive approach to recommend
surveillance imaging based only on expert opinion, unless the physician has personal experience to
justify a watchful-waiting approach, preferably involving observation of a sufficient number of cases
to suggest a likelihood of malignancy within the defined (≤ 2%) probably-benign range. Alternative-
ly, one should consider waiting for publication of more robust data. Further clinical studies for the
latter four proposed sets of sonographic findings, involving at least 500 cases for each proposed set
of findings, should be undertaken to demonstrate whether the likelihood of malignancy for any of
the findings is in the defined (≤ 2%) probably-benign range, and, when appropriate, the frequency
with which concurrent mammography will permit a benign (category 2) assessment instead.

**C. FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS**

**1. Which type of breast imaging examination should I recommend for my patients?**
When in doubt, refer to the ACR Appropriateness Criteria® (http://www.acr.org/Quality-Safety/Ap-
    propriateness-Criteria/Diagnostic/Breast-Imaging). The ACR Appropriateness Criteria® provides rec-
    ommendations for both screening and diagnostic breast imaging procedures.
**2. A woman in her 20’s consulted a gynecologist, who discovered a palpable breast mass; the**
    **woman thinks that the mass has been palpable for a long time, but the gynecologist insists**
    **on imaging, which shows probable fibroadenoma. What should the assessment be? Is biopsy**
    **always necessary?**
This scenario often presents a dilemma for the breast imager. Using feature analysis, a mass that
    is oval, circumscribed, solid, and oriented parallel to the skin, is very likely to be benign and most
    commonly a fibroadenoma. Especially for a woman in her 20’s, palpability of the mass will not
    appreciably affect the very low likelihood of malignancy. The correct assessment in this scenario
    would be probably benign (category 3), recommend surveillance imaging, unless the woman
    prefers biopsy or even excision if the mass is cyclically quite painful. However, even if the woman
    declines surveillance imaging and biopsy is done for this category 3 lesion, the probably benign
    assessment should NOT change.
**3. A woman undergoes breast US examination to evaluate spontaneous bloody nipple discharge,**
    **and I see a mass within a duct. How do I describe this using the BI-RADS** ® **lexicon?**
In such a case, the location of the mass is intraductal, in addition to a specified clock-face position
    and distance from the nipple. Most intraductal masses are papillomas, and a vascular stalk may be
    evident on color or power Doppler while scanning along the length of the duct from the nipple
    to the periphery. Stating the length of the duct segment that contains the mass or debris, size
    and intraductal location of such masses, presence of vascularity, clock-face and distance from the
    nipple is the most important information to convey, together with whether or not these are felt
    to explain the patient’s symptoms (if any). Most of these masses require biopsy, with BI-RADS® 4B
    assessment appropriate, given the approximately 15% risk of malignancy. Other considerations
    include clot or detritus and intracystic papillary carcinoma. Some irregular masses will show intra-
    ductal extension, with the latter often representing a DCIS component to an otherwise mostly in-
    vasive malignancy; in such cases, this is an associated feature of the main mass which itself should
    be more fully described by its shape, margins, orientation, posterior features, and echo pattern.
If no abnormality is identified in scanning over the length of the duct segment as it approaches
    the nipple, consider attempting a ductogram (galactogram), which may show peripheral ab-
    normalities more effectively than US.
**4. A 52-year-old woman with a family history of unilateral breast cancer (diagnosed in her moth-**
    **er at the age of 67 years) presents with a large, painful breast mass. Her mammograms show**
    **no abnormalities other than a 4 cm circumscribed mass, characterized at US as a simple cyst.**
    **For relief of her symptoms, she requests aspiration. What assessment and management rec-**
    **ommendations should be provided in the breast imaging report?**
The breast imaging report for her concurrent mammography and US examinations should pro-
    vide a benign (category 2) assessment. This is because the combination of mammographic and
    sonographic findings is characteristically benign (simple cyst). Two management recommenda-
    tions should be provided: (1) routine screening mammography in 1 year (concordant with the be-


### FIFTH EDITION — 2013

```
nign imaging findings), and (2) cyst aspiration for relief of symptoms. Note that the requested cyst
aspiration is for therapeutic rather than diagnostic purposes. This case illustrates one of several
assessment-management discordance scenarios, for which assessment should match the imaging
findings, not the planned management.
```
**5. When a woman is recalled from screening for an asymmetry, and spot-compression or spot-**
    **compression magnification views show no persistent abnormality, is it necessary to perform**
    **ultrasound?**
It is neither necessary nor appropriate to perform US in this scenario, because diagnostic mammo-
    graphic evaluation has proved that the asymmetry identified at screening was a summation artifact
    (superimposition of normal breast structures) — this, of course, assumes that the spot-compression/
    spot-compression magnification views were of diagnostic image quality, with the area of concern
    centered in the spot-compression paddle. Since there are no imaging findings at diagnostic mam-
    mography, this examination should be assessed as negative (category 1) with recommendation for
    routine screening mammography in 1 year. The above described scenario is quite common. An
    asymmetry is a noncalcified finding seen on only one standard mammographic view, and approxi-
    mately 80% of asymmetries are found to represent summation artifacts [23].
Had this scenario been slightly different, with spot-compression or spot-compression magnifica-
    tion views depicting a focal asymmetry (non-mass lesion visible on two different mammographic
    projections) as the only imaging finding, then it would indeed be appropriate to perform US tar-
    geted at the mammographic lesion. In most such cases, US examination will not affect subsequent
    management, identifying either normal-appearing fibroglandular tissue as correlate to the focal
    asymmetry or no sonographic finding at all. Such cases would be assessed as probably benign (cat-
    egory 3) unless prior mammograms demonstrated at least 2 to 3-year stability resulting in a benign
    (category 2) assessment. However, the value of US in this scenario is that in a few cases it will depict
    a suspicious finding instead, leading to biopsy and often, a cancer diagnosis that would otherwise
    have been deferred.
**6. In reporting the findings of a US examination, how many sonographic descriptors of a mass**
    **should be used to support its assessment? Is it acceptable to simply report that the mass has**
    **“benign” characteristics?**
There is no specific number of descriptors that must be used, but the three feature categories
    whose descriptors are applicable to characterizing a mass as benign are margin, shape, and orien-
    tation, all three of which should be used to completely characterize the mass. Within these feature
    categories, the descriptors that justify a benign assessment are circumscribed margin, oval shape
    (this now includes the term macrolobulated), and parallel orientation. If any other sonographic
    descriptor within these three feature categories is applicable to the mass, such as indistinct mar-
    gin, irregular shape, or not parallel orientation, the mass should be assessed as suspicious rather
    than as benign.
Reports should be clear and concise, and too many adjectives may detract from the message, but
    the referring clinician or the next radiologist who views the sonograms may appreciate knowing
    the criteria used to justify a benign assessment. Note that these descriptors need not be repeated in
    the assessment that is provided at the end of the sonographic report
**7. How should lesion location be reported on follow-up sonograms of a mass?**
A 42-year-old woman was found to have a circumscribed mass at baseline mammography. At
    diagnostic mammography and US, the mass was assessed as probably benign and its location


### BI-RADS® ATLAS — BREAST ULTRASOUND

```
at US was recorded as right breast, 10 o’clock, 5 cm posterior to the nipple. She returned for a
6-month follow-up US, and the sonographer told the interpreting physician that the mass was
located at 11 o’clock in the right breast 6 cm posterior to the nipple but that she had labeled
her images of the mass exactly as they had been annotated on the previous US examination.
The technologist asked the physician if what she had done was correct.
```
One could argue that there should be precise agreement concerning the location of a sono-
graphic finding on successive surveillance examinations, for the sake of consistency. However,
due to minor differences in both patient positioning and angles of insonation that are inher-
ent in real-time scanning with a handheld transducer, it may be difficult to precisely duplicate
the scanning conditions of a previous examination. As a result, the apparent clock-face location
and distance from the nipple of a mass may vary slightly between examinations. The key here
is to determine that the mass depicted on both examinations is one and the same. This is ac-
complished by real-time scanning not only at but also adjacent to the expected location of the
targeted mass, to ensure that the currently visible mass is the only such finding in the area. Once
this has been confirmed, a full set of diagnostic images should be recorded, with the images
labeled either precisely as on the previous examination or as actually located on the current
examination. If the current actual location is used in labeling, and if there is a slight difference
between this location and the location labeled previously, the report could state, “The right
breast mass seen previously at 10 o’clock position 5 cm posterior to the nipple is the same mass
seen on today’s exam in the right breast at 11 o’clock position 6 cm posterior to the nipple, the
minor difference being due to variability in patient positioning.” Thus, there will be no confusion
concerning the slight differences in lesion location described in the successive US reports.

**8. Ultrasound revealed a large axillary mass in a patient with known metastatic melanoma. Pre-**
    **viously this mass had been biopsied and shown to represent an axillary lymph node with meta-**
    **static melanoma. Except for the axillary mass, US examination revealed no abnormalities in**
    **the breast. What is the appropriate assessment for this examination?**

The appropriate assessment is benign (category 2). An assessment of known biopsy-proven
malignancy (category 6) would not be appropriate, as this assessment is used for known breast
cancers (defined in the BI-RADS® Atlas as being either invasive breast carcinoma or ductal car-
cinoma in situ). Note that other malignancies (lymphoma, leukemia, sarcoma, metastasis, etc),
even when present in the breast or axilla, are not considered to be breast cancer. To avoid
confusion concerning a benign assessment despite the presence of a non-breast malignancy,
the report should contain an added sentence explaining the situation. In this case, the report
could indicate that the axillary mass represents biopsy-proven metastatic melanoma, but that
there is no sonographic evidence of breast cancer.

Had this scenario been slightly different, with sonographic depiction of not only the axillary mass,
but also a mostly circumscribed but slightly indistinct solid mass within the breast, then the ap-
propriate assessment would be suspicious (category 4). The reason is that although this in-breast
lesion could represent another melanoma metastasis, it also could be a primary breast carcinoma,
such that biopsy is needed to make the distinction.

**9. Should assessment category 0 be applied to breast ultrasound examinations?**

In general, assessment category 0 should not be assigned to diagnostic breast ultrasound exami-
nations. This is because a full diagnostic breast imaging examination (involving both US and mam-
mography, if both are needed) should be completed before the patient leaves the breast imaging
facility. Rarely, if for either equipment or personnel issues, completion of the diagnostic ultrasound


### FIFTH EDITION — 2013

```
examination can not be completed or the patient decides to leave before completion of her work-
up, a category 0 may be given. In this scenario, if the diagnostic US examination is the one per-
formed first, it should be assessed as incomplete (category 0), and the patient will be asked to
return to complete her examination. When the patient returns and her examination is completed,
the initial category 0 assessment is replaced by a final assessment.
However, assessment category 0 indeed is appropriate for screening breast ultrasound exami-
nations. Like screening mammography, for which a small set of standard images is routinely
obtained, a similar small set of standard images is routinely obtained at screening US. When ad-
ditional images are recorded to further evaluate a screening-detected mammographic or sono-
graphic finding, the screening examination is assessed as incomplete (category 0) and the ad-
ditional images then constitute the subsequent diagnostic examination, regardless of whether
the patient needs to be recalled on a different day or the additional images are obtained only a
few minutes afterwards.
Note that in scenarios where both screening and diagnostic components of an examination are
performed one after the other, it may be awkward to report the two examinations separately. A
single report may be issued instead, containing a combined assessment that reflects the (more
completely evaluated) findings at diagnostic examination. However, the screening and diag-
nostic components of such a combined examination must be audited separately, audit-positive
for the screening examination (effectively reflecting a category 0 assessment), and either audit-
positive or audit-negative for the diagnostic examination depending on the final assessment
that is rendered.
```
**10. If handheld screening ultrasound is performed either by a physician or a technologist, does**
    **every potential abnormality identified at sonography need to be rescanned before an as-**
    **sessment is made?**
Identification of findings (“every potential abnormality”) at handheld US examination is ac-
    complished in real time by the operator, whether this is a technologist or the interpreting
    physician. Then, selected images are recorded. The interpreting physician then renders an as-
    sessment in the screening US report. The bottom line is that, at times, abnormalities are being
    identified and documented by a non-physician, but it is the physician’s responsibility to inter-
    pret the examination and render an assessment in the screening US report.
The situation is straightforward if the screening examination is performed by the interpreting
    physician, because he or she completes interpretation in real time, so the recorded images are suf-
    ficient and the patient is not rescanned. Rarely, the interpreting physician may call in a colleague
    for a second opinion, so rescanning will occur. However, in the vast majority of cases, rescanning
    is not necessary for “every potential abnormality” because the unimportant findings are dismissed
    and the important findings are appropriately documented immediately after real-time scanning.
The situation is more complex if a technologist scans the breasts, depending upon the policy
    established in the breast imaging facility. In some facilities, the established policy is that the in-
    terpreting physician always rescans the patient if the technologist identifies any potential abnor-
    mality. Using this approach, the interpreting physician then decides at real-time scanning how to
    interpret the examination, appropriate images are recorded, and an assessment is rendered in the
    screening US report. In effect, this approach is similar to physician-performed scanning except
    that the physician scans only those patients who have one or more potentially abnormal findings.
    However, rescanning is needed frequently.


### BI-RADS® ATLAS — BREAST ULTRASOUND

In other facilities, the established policy is that the technologist records images of every poten-
tial abnormality she identifies, and then the interpreting physician decides whether these images
are sufficient for rendering an assessment, hence whether rescanning is needed. This decision of
whether or not to rescan depends on how many images are recorded of each potential abnormal-
ity (this also is part of the established policy), how benign or suspicious each finding appears on
the recorded image(s), how much the interpreting physician trusts a given technologist to record
representative images of findings, and a variety of other factors. The frequency of rescanning using
this approach is intermediate between that of the two other approaches described previously.

**11. I have been asked to do a screening ultrasound examination of both breasts. I have only**
    **handheld scanning equipment. How should I perform the examiantion?**

There is no standard examination procedure for bilateral handheld whole-breast ultrasound,
but in some research studies, such as ACRIN 6666 [23], real-time handheld sonography was
performed by the interpreting physician, on a quadrant-by-quadrant basis without image cap-
ture. Transverse or antiradial scanning of a quadrant (sweeping from posterior to anterior) was
most efficient, then longitudinal or radial scanning of that quadrant, concluding with scanning
just posterior to the nipple. Representative images were captured: one of each quadrant in the
radial plane at the same distance posterior to the nipple, 4 cm on average, with appropriate
annotation of each image (for example, R breast, 10 o’clock, 4 cm FN), and last, recording of
the retroareolar image. These were the images recorded when no findings were identified, and
constituted the images for a negative (category 1) screening US examination.

Note that ACRIN 6666 was a research study, for which there was interest in capturing fully doc-
umented (diagnostic) images of many findings that were assessed as benign, and at which the
average examination time was 19 minutes [23]. At service screening (screening in usual clinical
practice), it will be much more time efficient to limit the frequency of recording full-documenta-
tion images of benign-assessed findings, especially because each such finding will be assessed as
characteristically benign at real-time scanning, and also because future comparison is not needed
for a characteristically benign finding. (If it remains characteristically benign at subsequent exami-
nation, a change in size is unimportant: if it no longer is characteristically benign at subsequent
examination, an abnormal interpretation will be made). For each characteristically benign finding
that is described in the US report, consider recording only one representative image (instead of
a standard negative image of that quadrant). Also note that it is not necessary to describe all (or
even any) characteristically benign findings in a screening US report, but instead render a negative
(category 1) assessment. Indeed, in usual clinical practice (service screening), most interpreting
physicians do not describe characteristically benign findings at screening mammography.

If an important finding (especially one that will require either surveillance imaging or biopsy)
is identified during handheld scanning, return to it and record orthogonal views with and
without measurement calipers, following the same procedure as for a diagnostic examina-
tion. This, in effect, converts the screening examination into a (recalled) diagnostic exami-
nation. If the study is performed by someone other than the interpreting physician, and if
images of a potential abnormality are recorded that are judged insufficient for assessment
by the interpreting physician, the patient should be recalled if she has left the breast imaging
facility or rescanned before she leaves, so that a final assessment and a management recom-
mendation may be made and communicated.


### FIFTH EDITION — 2013

**12. For bilateral screening US performed either by the technologist or the physician with no ab-**
    **normality identified, what images should I record?**
Although no standard has been set for documenting a negative screening US examination, what
    was done in ACRIN 6666 **[LINK]** has served well in many breast imaging practices that now offer
    screening US: in addition to demographics (patient’s name, unique identifier, date of birth or age,
    facility name and location), record one image in one plane (ordinarily radial) for each quadrant, at
    the same distance posterior to the nipple (4 cm for an average breast), and also record one image
    of the retroareolar region just behind the nipple. The axilla could be scanned as well, but this was
    not required in the ACRIN 6666 protocol, nor was there a requirement to record a representative
    negative image. The standard set of five images per breast was recorded at the completion of real-
    time scanning, given that no abnormalities were suspected or observed. The radial plane of capture
    was selected for consistency, but did not reflect scanning technique, which was done quadrant-
    by-quadrant in transverse/longitudinal or antiradial/radial planes (please see FAQ 11). Also refer to
    FAQ 11 for a discussion of what images to record when you decide to render a benign (catgegory 2)
    assessment.
**13. Should I avoid using breast US for male patients with clinical findings because gynecomastia**
    **may be misinterpreted as malignancy?**
No. US is indicated for evaluation of most palpable abnormalities, regardless of the patient’s
    gender. Men with palpable masses located far from the nipple would be referred for US on com-
    pletion of mammography. Gynecomastia itself is frequently palpable and tender, with mam-
    mography most commonly being definitive in confirming the diagnosis. If US is performed,
    however, gynecomastia may also be recognized (please see the discussion of anatomy in the
    lexicon).
As we do in mammography and in imaging other paired organs, it is important to keep the prin-
    ciple of symmetry in mind. If there is doubt about whether US shows a physiologic change (such as
    gynecomastia) or an abnormality that requires biopsy, scan the contralateral retroareolar area for a
    similar but usually smaller area (in this case, of gynecomastia). Palpable masses at sites away from
    the nipple, usually in fatty areas of the male breast, can be completely characterized using mam-
    mographic feature analysis, with the role of US limited to providing imaging guidance for biopsy,
    if palpation-guided biopsy is not performed.

BREAST TISSUE
```
**A. Tissue composition:** The background echotexture of the breast may affect the sensitivity of breast sonograms for lesion
detection. (select one)
 **1. Homogeneous background echotexture — fat**
 **2. Homogeneous background echotexture — fibroglandular**
 **3. Heterogeneous background echotexture
FINDINGS**

**B. Masses:** A mass is three dimensional and occupies space. In 2-D ultrasound, it should be seen in two different planes;
with volumetric acquisitions, in three planes.
	1. **Shape** (select one) 	a. Oval Elliptical or egg-shaped (may include 2 or 3 undulations,
i.e. “gently lobulated” or “macrolobulated”)
	b. Round Spherical, ball-shaped, circular, or globular
	c. Irregular Neither round nor oval
	2. **Orientation**
(select one)

```
	a. Parallel Long axis of lesion parallels the skin line (“wider than tall”
or horizontal)
	b. Not parallel Long axis not oriented along the skin line (“taller than
wide” or “vertical”) – includes round
	3. Margin (select all
that apply)
```
```
	a. Circumscribed A margin that is well defined or sharp, with an abrupt
transition between the lesion and surrounding tissue
 b. Not Circumscribed The mass has one or more of the following features: indis-
tinct, angular, microlobulated, or spiculated in any portion
of the margin
	i. Indistinct No clear demarcation between a mass and the surround-
ing tissue
	ii. Angular Some or all of the margin has sharp corners, often form-
ing acute angles
	iii. Microlobulated Margin is characterized by short-cycle undulations
	iv. Spiculated Margin is characterized by sharp lines radiating from the
mass
	4. Echo pattern
(select one)
```
```
	a. Anechoic Without internal echoes
```
```
	b. Hyperechoic Having increased echogenicity relative to fat or equal to
fibroglandular tissue
	c. Complex cystic and solid Mass contains both anechoic (cystic and fluid) and echo-
genic (solid) components
	d. Hypoechoic Defined relative to subcutaneous fat; masses are char-
acterized by low-level echoes throughout (e.g., compli-
cated cysts or fibroadenomas)
	e. Isoechoic Having the same echogenicity as subcutaneous fat
	f. Heterogeneous A mixture of echogenic patterns within a solid mass

ACR BI-RADS® — Ultrasound Lexicon Classification Form
For each of the following categories, select the term that best describes the dominant lesion feature. Wherever
possible, definitions and descriptions used in BI-RADS® for mammography should be applied to ultrasound.
```

### FIFTH EDITION — 2013

```
	5. Posterior acoustic
features
(select one)
```
```
	a. No posterior acoustic
features
```
```
No shadowing or enhancement deep to the mass
```
	b. Enhancement Appears as a column that is more echogenic (whiter)
deep to the mass
	c. Shadowing The area posterior to the mass appears darker; edge
shadows should be disregarded
	d. Combined pattern More than one pattern of posterior attenuation, both
shadowing and enhancement
**C. Calcifications:** Calcifications are poorly characterized with ultrasound but can be recognized as echogenic foci, particularly
when in a mass. (if present, select all that apply)
	1. **Calcifications in a
mass**

```
Small hyperechoic foci will be more conspicuous in a
hypoechoic mass than within a volume of fibroglandu-
lar tissue (unless grouped very closely or individually
coarse, they will not attenuate the US beam)
	2. Calcifications out-
side of a mass
```
Often difficult to discern, small echogenic flecks
grouped in tissue (unless grouped very closely or indi-
vidually coarse, they will not attenuate the US beam)
	3. **Intraductal calcifi-
cations outside of
a mass
D. Associated features** (select all that apply)

```
	1. Architectural
distortion
	2. Duct changes Manifested by cystic dilation of a duct or ducts involv-
ing irregularities in caliber and/or arborization, exten-
sion of duct(s) to or from a malignant mass, or the
presence of an intraductal mass, thrombus, or detritus
```
3. **Skin changes**
    (select all that apply)

```
	a. Skin thickening Focal or diffuse skin thickening-more than 2 mm in thick-
ness (in the periareolar area and inframammary folds up
to 4 mm)
	b. Skin retraction Skin surface is concave or ill-defined, and appears
pulled in
 4. Edema Increased echogenicity of surrounding tissue: reticu-
lated (angular, interconnected) pattern of hypoechoic,
irregular lines
```
5. **Vascularity**
    (select one)

```
Must reference a contralateral normal area or unaffected
site in the same breast as the basis for comparison – it is
important that vascularity alone not be used as the only
diagnostic feature in interpretation
	a. Avascular
	b. Internal vascularity Blood vessels present within the mass
	c. Vessels in rim Blood vessels may be marginal, occupying part or all of a
mass’s rim
```
6. **Elasticity**
    **assessment**
    (select one)

```
Stiffness as a feature of malignant masses may be consid-
ered along with their much more important morphologic
characteristics
	a. Soft
	b. Intermediate
	c. Hard
```

echoes; may have layered appearance which may shift
slowly with changes in the patient’s position; may con-
tain echogenic foci that appear to scintillate as they shift
 4. Mass in or on skin These masses are clinically apparent and may include
sebaceous or epidermal inclusion cysts, keloids, moles,
pimples, neurofibromas, and accessory nipples
 5. Foreign body

injected or leaked silicone, metal or glass related to
trauma, and implants
 6. Lymph nodes —
intramammary
```
```
Circumscribed, oval masses, often reniform and contain-
ing hilar fat; most commonly seen in the upper outer
quadrant (especially the axillary tail); usually 3 mm to 1 cm
