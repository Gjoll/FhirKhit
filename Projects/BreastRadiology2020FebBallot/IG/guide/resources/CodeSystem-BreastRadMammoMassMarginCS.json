      "definition": "(historically, \"well defined\" or \"sharply defined\") The margin is sharply demarcated with an abrupt transition between the lesion and the surrounding tissue. For mammography, if part of the margin is obscured, at least 75% of the margin must be well defined for a mass to qualify as “circumscribed”. A mass for which any portion of the margin is indistinct, microlobulated, or spiculated should be classified on the basis of the latter (the most suspicious component)."

      "definition": "A margin that is hidden by superimposed or adjacent fibroglandular tissue. This is used primarily when some of the margin of the mass is circumscribed, but the rest (more than 25%) is hidden."

      "code": "Microlobulated",

      "definition": "The margin is characterized by short cycle undulations. For mammography, use of this descriptor usually implies a suspicious finding."

      "display": "Indistinct Margin",
      "definition": "There is no clear demarcation of the entire margin, or of any portion of the margin, from the surrounding tissue. For mammography, this descriptor should not be used when the interpreting physician believes it is likely due to immediately adjacent breast tissue. Use of this descriptor usually implies a suspicious finding."

      "display": "Spiculated Margin",
      "definition": "The margin is characterized by lines radiating from the mass. Use of this descriptor usually implies a suspicious finding."
