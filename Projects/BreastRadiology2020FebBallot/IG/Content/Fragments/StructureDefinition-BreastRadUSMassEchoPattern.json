While many completely echogenic masses are benign, prospective assessment as\nbenign has greater dependency on marginal circumscription. Although the echo pattern\ncontributes with other feature categories to the assessment of a breast lesion, echogenicity\nalone has little specificity.\n-- Bi-Rads® Atlas — Mammography Fifth Ed. 2013",
