  "description": "---\n** ReviewStatus: NotReviewed **\n---\nBreat Radiology Mammography Solitary Dilated Duct Observation\n\n\nIf this observation is present, and dataAbsentReason is empty, then a solitary dilated duct was observed.\n\n\nIf this observation is present, and dataAbsentReason is not empty, then a solitary dilated duct was not observed and dataAbsentReason contains the reason why.\n\n\nThis is a unilateral tubular or branching structure that likely represents a dilated or otherwise en-\nlarged duct. It is a rare finding. Even if unassociated with other suspicious clinical or mammographic\nfindings, it has been reported to be associated with noncalcified DCIS.\n-- Bi-Rads® Atlas — Mammography Fifth Ed. 2013",
