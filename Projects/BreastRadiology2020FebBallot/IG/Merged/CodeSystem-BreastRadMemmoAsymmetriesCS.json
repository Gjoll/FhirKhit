      "definition": "This is an area of fibroglandular-density tissue that is visible on only one mammographic projection. Most such findings represent summation artifact, a superimposition of normal breast structures, whereas those confirmed to be real lesions (by subsequent demonstration on at least one more projection) may represent one of the other types of asymmetry or a mass."

    {
      "code": "GlobalAsymmetry",
      "display": "Global Asymmetry",
      "definition": "Global asymmetry is judged relative to the corresponding area in the contralateral breast and represents a large amount of fibroglandular-density tissue over a substantial portion of the breast (at least one quadrant). There is no mass, distorted architecture or associated suspicious calcifications. Global asymmetry usually represents a normal variant."

    {
      "code": "FocalAsymmetry",
      "display": "Focal Asymmetry",
      "definition": "A focal asymmetry is judged relative to the corresponding location in the contralateral breast, and represents a relatively small amount of fibroglandular-density tissue over a confined portion of the breast (less than one quadrant). It is visible on and has similar shape on different mammographic projections (hence a real finding rather than superimposition of normal breast structures), but it lacks the convex-outward borders and the conspicuity of a mass. Rather, the borders of a focal asymmetry are concave-outward, and it usually is seen to be interspersed with fat. Note that occasionally what is properly described as a focal asymmetry at screening (a finding visible  on standard MLO and CC views) is determined at diagnostic mammography to be 2 different findings, each visible on only 1 standard view (hence, 2 asymmetries), each of which ultimately is judged to represent superimposition of normal breast structures. Also, not infrequently, what is properly described as a focal asymmetry at screening is determined at diagnostic evaluation (mammography and/or ultrasound) to represent a mass."

    {
      "code": "DevelopingAsymmetry",
      "display": "Developing Asymmetry",
      "definition": "This is a focal asymmetry that is new, larger, or more conspicuous than on a previous examination. Approximately 15% of cases of developing asymmetry are found to be malignant (either invasive carcinoma, DCIS, or both), so these cases warrant further imaging evaluation and biopsy unless found to be characteristically benign (e.g., simple cyst at directed ultrasound). Absence of a sonographic correlate, especially for a small (< 1 cm) developing asymmetry, should not avert biopsy."
