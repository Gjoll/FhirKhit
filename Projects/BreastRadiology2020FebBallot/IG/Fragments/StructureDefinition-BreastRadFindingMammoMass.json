  "description": "Breast Radiology Finding Mammography Mass Observation\n\n\nIf this observation is present, and dataAbsentReason is empty, then a mass was observed and Shape, Margin, and Density observations should be referenced by this observation.\n\n\nIf this observation is present, and dataAbsentReason is not empty, then a calcification  was not observed and dataAbsentReason contains the reason why and no Shape, Margin, or Density observations should be referenced by this observation\n\n\n### BI-RADS® ATLAS — MAMMOGRAPHY### FIFTH EDITION — 2013\"MASS\" is three dimensional and occupies space. It is seen on two different mammographic pro-\njections. It has completely or partially convex-outward borders and (when radiodense) appears\ndenser in the center than at the periphery. If a potential mass is seen only on a single projection, it\nshould be called an \"ASYMMETRY\" until its 3-dimensionality is confirmed\n### END BI-RADS® ATLAS — MAMMOGRAPHY TEXTThis observation has the following three member observations\n\n\n** Shape\n** Margin\n** Density\nIf the CodedValue value is set to present, then references to the above member observations should be \npresent and non-null, otherwise references should be empty",
