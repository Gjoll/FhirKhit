  "description": "Breast Radiology Mammography Asymmetries Observation\n\n\nIf this observation is present, and dataAbsentReason is empty, then an asymmetry was observed.\n\n\nIf this observation is present, and dataAbsentReason is not empty, then an asymmetry was not observed and dataAbsentReason contains the reason why.\n\n\n> The several types of asymmetry involve a spectrum of mammographic findings that represent\n> unilateral deposits of fibroglandular tissue not conforming to the definition of a radiodense mass.\n> The asymmetry, unlike a mass, is visible on only 1 mammographic projection. The other 3 types of\n> asymmetry, although visible on more than 1 projection, have concave-outward borders and usu-\n> ally are seen to be interspersed with fat, whereas a radiodense mass displays completely or partially\n> convex-outward borders and appears to be denser in the center than at the periphery.\n>> -- {BiRadCitatio}",
