  "description": "Breast Radiology Mammography Calcification Observation\n\n\nIf this observation is present, and dataAbsentReason is empty, then a calcification was observed.\n\n\nIf this observation is present, and dataAbsentReason is not empty, then a calcification was not observed and dataAbsentReason contains the reason why and no Type or Distribution observations should be referenced by this observation\n\n\n> Calcifications that are assessed as benign at mammography are typically larger, coarser, round with\n> smooth margins, and more easily seen than malignant calcifications. Calcifications associated with\n> malignancy (and many benign calcifications as well) are usually very small and often require the use\n> of magnification to be seen well. When a specific typically benign etiology cannot be assigned, a\n> description of calcifications should include their morphology and distribution. Calcifications that are\n> obviously benign need not be reported, especially if the interpreting physician is concerned that\n> the referring clinician or patient might infer anything other than absolute confidence in benignity\n> were such calcifications described in the report. However, typically benign calcifications should be\n> reported if the interpreting physician is concerned that other observers might misinterpret them as\n> anything but benign were such calcifications not described in the report.\n> As an ASSOCIATED FEATURE, this may be used in conjunction with one or more other FINDING(S)\n> to describe calcifications within or immediately adjacent to the finding(s)\n>> -- {BiRadCitatio} \nThis observation has the following two member observations\n\n\n** Calcification Type\n** Calcification Distribution",
