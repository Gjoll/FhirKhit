The radiographic densities of 91 biopsy-proved, nonfatty,\nnoncalcified breast masses were evaluated by three mammographers. The density determinations made by\neach observer were compared with the histologic outcome for the 51 benign and 40 malignant lesions. With\nthe kappa statistic, interobserver agreement was relatively poor (0.22 to 0.49), and intraobserver agreement for\none expert mammographer was 0.50. When the majority opinion of the mammographers was used, sensitivity\nwas 48%, specificity was 80%, and both positive and negative predictive values were 66%. As a solitary feature\nin lesion analysis, mammographic density is difficult to assess and is of limited value for the prediction of the\nbenign or malignant nature of noncalcified breast masses.\n### END BI-RADS® ATLAS — MAMMOGRAPHY TEXT",
