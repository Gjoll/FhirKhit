  "description": "Breast Radiology Mammography Mass Density Observation\n\n\nIf this observation is present, and dataAbsentReason is empty, then a mass density was observed.\n\n\nIf this observation is present, and dataAbsentReason is not empty, then a mass density was not observed and dataAbsentReason contains the reason why.\n\n\n> Radiographic density is considered an important feature in the evaluation of noncalcified breast masses, yet\n> no studies assessing its value have been published. The radiographic densities of 91 biopsy-proved, nonfatty,\n> noncalcified breast masses were evaluated by three mammographers. The density determinations made by\n> each observer were compared with the histologic outcome for the 51 benign and 40 malignant lesions. With\n> the kappa statistic, interobserver agreement was relatively poor (0.22 to 0.49), and intraobserver agreement for\n> one expert mammographer was 0.50. When the majority opinion of the mammographers was used, sensitivity\n> was 48%, specificity was 80%, and both positive and negative predictive values were 66%. As a solitary feature\n> in lesion analysis, mammographic density is difficult to assess and is of limited value for the prediction of the\n> benign or malignant nature of noncalcified breast masses.\n>> -- {BiRadCitatio}",
