  "description": "Breast Radiology Mammography Skin Lesion Observation\n\n\nIf this observation is present, and dataAbsentReason is empty, then a skin lesion was observed.\n\n\nIf this observation is present, and dataAbsentReason is not empty, then a skin lesion was not observed and dataAbsentReason contains the reason why.\n\n\n> This finding may be described in the mammography report or annotated on the mammographic\n> image when it projects over the breast (especially on 2 different projections), and may be mistaken\n> for an intramammary lesion. A raised skin lesion sufficiently large to be seen at mammography\n> should be marked by the technologist with a radiopaque device designated for use as a marker for\n> a skin lesion.\n>> -- BI-RADS® ATLAS — MAMMOGRAPHY FIFTH EDITION — 2013",
