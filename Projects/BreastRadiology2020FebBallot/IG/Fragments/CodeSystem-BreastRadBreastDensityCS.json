      "definition": "(historically, there are scattered fibroglandular densities). It may be helpful to distinguish breasts in which there are a few scattered areas of fibroglandular-density tissue from those in which there are moderate scattered areas of fibroglandular-density tissue. Note that there has been a subtle change in the wording of this category, to conform to BI-RADS® lexicon use of the term “density” to describe the degree of x-ray attenuation of breast tissue but not to represent discrete mammographic findings."

      "code": "HeterogeneouslyDense",
      "display": "The breasts are heterogeneously dense, which may obscure detection of small masses",
      "definition": "It is not uncommon for some areas in such breasts to be relatively dense while other areas are primarily fatty. When this occurs, it may be helpful to describe the location(s) of the denser tissue in a second sentence, so that the referring clinician is aware that these are the areas in which small noncalcified lesions may be obscured. Suggested wordings for the second sentence include: \"The dense tissue is located anteriorly in both breasts, and the posterior portions are mostly fatty.\"\"Primarily dense tissue is located in the upper outer quadrants of both breasts; scattered areas of fibroglandular tissue are present in the remainder of the breasts.\""

    {
      "code": "ExtremelyDense",
      "display": "The breasts are extremely dense, which lowers the sensitivity of mammography.",
      "definition": "The sensitivity of mammography is lowest in this density category. The Fourth Edition of BI-RADS®, unlike previous editions, indicated quartile ranges of percentage dense tissue (increments of 25% density) for each of the four density categories, with the expectation that the assignment of breast density would be distributed more evenly across categories than the historical distribution of 10% fatty, 40% scattered, 40% heterogeneously and 10% extremely dense. However, it has since been demonstrated in clinical practice that there has been essentially no change in this historical distribution across density categories, despite the 2003 guidance provided in the BI-RADS® Atlas."
