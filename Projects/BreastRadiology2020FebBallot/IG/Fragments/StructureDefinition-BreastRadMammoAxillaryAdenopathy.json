  "description": "Breast Radiology Mammography Axillary Adenopathy Observation\n\n\nIf this observation is present, and dataAbsentReason is empty, then an axillary adenopathy was observed.\n\n\nIf this observation is present, and dataAbsentReason is not empty, then an axillary adenopathy was not observed and dataAbsentReason contains the reason why.\n\n\n> Enlarged axillary lymph nodes may warrant comment, clinical correlation, and additional \n> evaluation, especially if new or considerably larger or rounder when compared to previous examination.\n> A review of the patientâ€™s medical history may elucidate the cause for axillary adenopathy, averting\n> recommendation for additional evaluation. When one or more large axillary nodes are \n> substantially composed of fat, this is a normal variant.\n>> -- {BiRadCitatio}",
