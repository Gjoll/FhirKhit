  "description": "Breast Radiology Ultra-Sound Mass Orientation Observation\n\n\nIf this observation is present, and dataAbsentReason is empty, then a mass orientation was observed.\n\n\nIf this observation is present, and dataAbsentReason is not empty, then a mass orientation was not observed and dataAbsentReason contains the reason why.\n\n\nThis feature of masses is unique to US imaging. Orientation is defined with reference to the skin\nline. Obliquely situated masses may follow a radial pattern, and their long axes will help determine\nclassification as parallel or not parallel. Parallel or \"wider-than-tall\" orientation is a property of most\nbenign masses, notably fibroadenomas; however, many carcinomas have this orientation as well.\nOrientation alone should not be used as an isolated feature in assessing a mass for its likelihood of\nmalignancy.\n-- Bi-Rads® Atlas — Mammography Fifth Ed. 2013",
