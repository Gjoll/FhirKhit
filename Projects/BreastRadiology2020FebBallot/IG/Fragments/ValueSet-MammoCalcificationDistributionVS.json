Multiple\n> similar groups may be described in the report when there is more than one group of calcifications\n> that are similar in morphology and distribution. In evaluating the likelihood of malignancy for calcifications, \n> distribution is at least as important as morphology.\n>> -- BI-RADS® ATLAS — MAMMOGRAPHY FIFTH EDITION — 2013",
