Heterogeneity has little prognostic value in differentiating benign from malignant masses, but it is not uncommon to observe heterogeneity in fibroadenomas as well as cancers. Clumped areas of different echogenicity may elevate the suspicion for malignancy, particularly in a mass whose margins are not circumscribed and whose shape is irregular."
