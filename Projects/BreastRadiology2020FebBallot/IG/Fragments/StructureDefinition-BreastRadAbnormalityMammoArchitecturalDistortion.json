  "description": "Mammography Breast Abnormality Architectural Distortion Observation\n\n\n### BI-RADS® ATLAS — MAMMOGRAPHY### FIFTH EDITION — 2013The parenchyma is distorted with no definite mass visible. For mammography, this includes thin\nstraight lines or spiculations radiating from a point, and focal retraction, distortion or straightening\nat the anterior or posterior edge of the parenchyma. Architectural distortion may also be associ-\nated with a mass, asymmetry, or calcifications. In the absence of appropriate history of trauma or\nsurgery, architectural distortion is suspicious for malignancy or radial scar, and tissue diagnosis is\nappropriate.\n### END BI-RADS® ATLAS — MAMMOGRAPHY TEXT",
