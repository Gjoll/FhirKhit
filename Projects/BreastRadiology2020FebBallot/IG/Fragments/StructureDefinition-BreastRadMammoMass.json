It is seen on two different mammographic pro-\njections. It has completely or partially convex-outward borders and (when radiodense) appears\ndenser in the center than at the periphery. If a potential mass is seen only on a single projection, it\nshould be called an \"ASYMMETRY\" until its 3-dimensionality is confirmed\n### END BI-RADS® ATLAS — MAMMOGRAPHY TEXTThis observation has the following three member observations\n\n\n** Shape\n** Margin\n** Density\nIf the CodedValue value is set to present, then references to the above member observations should be \npresent and non-null, otherwise references should be empty",
