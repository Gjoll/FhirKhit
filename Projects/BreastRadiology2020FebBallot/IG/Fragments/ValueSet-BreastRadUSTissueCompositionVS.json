  "description": "Breast Radiology Ultra-Sound Tissue Composition Observation\n\n\n> The wide normal variability in tissue composition seen on mammograms can also be observed\n> on US images. Just as increasing breast density diminishes the sensitivity of mammography in the\n> detection of small masses, heterogeneous background echotexture of the breast may affect the\n> sensitivity of breast sonograms for lesion detection.\n>> -- BI-RADS® ATLAS — MAMMOGRAPHY FIFTH EDITION — 2013",
