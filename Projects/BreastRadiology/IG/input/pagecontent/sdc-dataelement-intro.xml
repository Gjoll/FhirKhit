  <h3>Scope and Usage</h3>
  <p>
    Data elements allow the definition of standardized data 'chunks' that can form the basis for Questionnaire questions.  Maintaining questions independently
    from a Questionnaire enables increased consistency across Questionnaires.  Questionnaire authors can draw potential questions from a registry of defined
    data elements.  This allows data captured by different forms to be consistent.  It also allows re-use of mapping information, choice definitions, etc.
  </p>
  <p>
    In FHIR, the StructureDefinition can be used to represent a single data element (as a 
    <a href="{{site.data.fhir.path}}structuredefinition.html#logical">logical model</a>).  It's also possible to define collections of data elements, or to
    point to existing collections, for example FHIR resources, and more specifically, to refer to individual elements within the structure definition.  This
    is done by specifying the canonical URL of the StructureDefinition followed by '#' and the id associated with that element.  For example,
    "http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/Patient#Patient.name".

    This profile sets expectations for use of the <a href="{{site.data.fhir.path}}structuredefinition.html">StructureDefinition</a> resource when used as 
    a means of representing data elements that can be leveraged as Questionnaire questions.  It identifies which core elements and extensions must be 
    supported and highlights other elements that, while not required, may be relevant to the Questionnaire use-case.
