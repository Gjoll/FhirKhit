  <h3>Scope and Usage</h3>
  <p>
    This profile expands adds additional constraints and extensions to the <a href="sdc-questionnaire.html">base SDC questionnaire profile</a> that define
    basic expectations for searching repositories for questionnaires of interest.  I.e. It identifies which elements of Questionnaire searchable metadata
    should be supported as well as identifying others of potential relevance.  Further information on how this use-case is implemented as well as guidance 
    on on the elements and extensions included in the profile can be found on the <a href="search.html">Finding a Questionnaire</a> page.
