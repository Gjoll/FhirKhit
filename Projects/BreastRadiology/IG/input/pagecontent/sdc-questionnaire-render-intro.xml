  <h3>Scope and Usage</h3>
  <p>
    This profile expands adds additional constraints and extensions to the <a href="sdc-questionnaire.html">base SDC questionnaire profile</a> that support
    the design of questionnaires with more sophisticated rendering, including tables, specialized controls, styled text, etc.  This profile identifies which 
    core elements and extensions must be supported and highlights other elements that, while not required, may be relevant to the questionnaire rendering
    use-case.  Further information on how this use-case is implemented as well as guidance on on the elements and extensions included in the profile can be 
    found on the <a href="rendering.html">Advanced Rendering</a> page.
